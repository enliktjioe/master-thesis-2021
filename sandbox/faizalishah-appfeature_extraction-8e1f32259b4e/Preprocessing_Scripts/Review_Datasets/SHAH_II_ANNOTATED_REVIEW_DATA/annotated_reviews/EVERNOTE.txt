11521     Update: EN has evolved into a solid, useful app. More often a go-to app. 

I&#39;ve used EN for years, and love the iPhone version, but 4.0 has real problem crashing. The only App I&#39;ve seen cause iPhone to restart. Not good.

Update: The new version 4.0.1 is worse than the previous. Crashes on start now. This App is not ready for mission critical use.

Update 03-02-2013: After fixing App crash issues, I am unable to login to my Evernote account at all.
8707      Couldn&#39;t do without it :)
6754      It&#39;s the beatest
6465      I would give this app five stars if I didn&#39;t have to upgrade in order to increase my monthly storage capacity. I must say though that It keeps me super organized and on task. I love the new alarm setting. The ability clip things from the web and access it from anywhere is priceless. I use it from my daily to do list to planning long term goals. It&#39;s indispensable.
7174      I love this app, the way it keeps your notes synchronized is great, but there&#39;s a couple things I wish we&#39;re improved. Please fix the spell-check word replacement, spaces that I typed keep disappearing when I choose a word to replace. This happens even when the words are the same length! :/ That needs to change. Lastly, it&#39;s not apparent that I can move notes between notebooks. Please either add this feature or explain that it is in the Premium version. Thanks!
7517      Does everything I need it to do. Perfect!
7256      Excellent for efficiency!
8719      Absolutely LOVE Evernote--one of the best applications ever! This particular app leaves some to be desired. It would be better if it had more of the look and feel of the desktop apps. That said, accessing all your notes is pretty straightforward and great to have on the iPad!
10984     Love the synch
11458     It used to sync across my devices flawlessly and quickly, and I could access any doc anywhere. Now I don&#39;t know when docs will sync, and sometimes I can&#39;t open them offline, which I guess is supposed to make me want to upgrade to Pro? No thanks, I just want it the way it was when I started using it.
4977      Evernote has deemed itself useless to me without an ability to sync. I want access to my old notes or I will uninstall Evernote and get another app in November
11073     I&#39;m fairly new to the Apple world and have been slowly making my way through all of the organizational and management options.  Evernote can highly recommended by several people and it has lived up to the expectations.  I don&#39;t think I am using it fully yet but I am very happy with it as is and it&#39;s potential.  This is the kind of product that made me choose Apple products.
10036     Don&#39;t know how I existed before Evernote. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
4171      I use a lot this app. But I would like to have the availability to modify size and color of a word or whole sentence in a paragraph. In side of the iPad application.
3815      Love it when it works!  Has been frozen since update !  Please fix !
4570      It keeps me organized and easy to share files
11323     Evernote crashes immediately after opening on iPad Mini. Please help!
9744      I absolutely think the world of this app. It helps me stay organized on the go and is accessible anywhere. Making lists, capturing moments, and holding words are only a few of the best parts of this app. I will forever love it!
9323      A great app to keep track of lists, important items of information, ideas, recipes, etc. To have it accessible on every device, to sync automatically, to be able to search for specific notes ... Evernote is all that I need! Love it. Can&#39;t imagine ever going back to post-its everywhere. LOL!
5174      Evernote used to be one of my favorite apps, now it&#39;s muddled with crap. Simplify it and quit trying to sell me over priced business socks.
8110      This a wonderful app for people like me that have memory challenges.  If I put something in a paper file, and then in a cabinet, it&#39;s gone!  This syncs across all of my devices so I have everything where I needed it.  great product!
3717      I am a highschool student, and I use evernote EVERY SINGLE DAY both in my personal and educational life, I love it!:)
8957      very useful.
5239      Since the update this app is totally worthless. Crashes, freezes, won&#39;t open-very frustrating. Surprised that it is taking so long to fix. I had heard Evernote cares for it&#39;s customers.
10143     Good app, functions well and does everything as described.
11681     Can no longer access my info after the new update.  FIX IT FAST!!!!!
10602     Combine Evernote with &#39;Getting Things Done&#39; and you&#39;ll be supremely happy! Try The Secret Weapon website
6168      The app cannot start ever since I updated to the latest version. Please fix!!!
11245     Love it so much that I would actually consider going premium. It&#39;s the best when used with the corresponding  computer program.
10348     My first review for the best app I&#39;ve used.  Thanks Evernote !
7758      A essential for any tablet user or ANY entrepreneur. It&#39;s capability and conveniences will make you wonder how you went without it (or how you used the Notes function so long)!
10287     I use it for everything from work ideas to grocery lists.  This has become my number one note taking app for both work and home.
7434      This is a good app. I use it often. I&#39;m a lazy dude, but when Evernote asked me to write a review, instead of choosing &#34;remind me later&#34; like I always do, I said &#34;ok Evernote, I&#39;ll do that.&#34; So Evernote is great, you can sync notebooks and share and use audio and pics and even make toast with this app. It&#39;s great so get it.
4974      Love some of the new features, and the new layout, but this version is very buggy. Almost like a beta version instead if a release candidate version. 

REALLY need to fix camera roll issue. It&#39;s not possible to take a photo and then use it in Evernote (unless you want to wait days or weeks for it to show up when you go in to the camera roll from the app). Been broken for a while now, and it&#39;s making it very hard to use the app.
11320     Absolutely horrible
I have midterms and due to the &#34;password reset&#34; I am Locked out of my account and have lost ALL OF MY NOTES for this school semester 

Can&#39;t recommend this to anyone.
Worst note application &#34;EVER&#34;
4871      I&#39;m so confused! I&#39;m reading these terrible reviews and I LOVE this version! It&#39;s clean, simple looking and so easy to use. 
Please don&#39;t change it! I thought the previous version was terrible and crappy looking! 
If you&#39;re confused about where stuff is at, I&#39;m not really sure you need to be using a phone to begin with... 
Love this, favorite version so far!
11651     This is a 5 star up please please fix still crashing !!
Still love his app but latest update with snippets is crashing sorted snippets alphabetically can&#39;t resort on date created app crashes
5171      I love Evernote but this version of the app is completely broken on my 4s.  Crashes or freezes repeatedly--can&#39;t open any notebooks.
9400      The more I learn about it the more I love it!!! Use it every day.
7952      I use Evernote constantly: in my classroom, taking notes trainings or at church, journaling and personal writing projects, and to organize my day-to-day activities. I love the fact that I can access my stuff from any computer, from my iPad, and phone. I no longer have to worry that I forgot my hard copies! I always have what I need when I need it. The app is also to me much more user-friendly than other similar apps, such as Dropbox.
8075      I have nearly 100 apps. This the one I use the most and one of my favorites. It is extremely useful.
7850      Keeps all my notes on all my devices for work and life (honey-do lists, etc). Definitely a must have app.
11351     Three weeks ago I thought you app sounded good and I might benefit from it.  Boy was I wrong!  Good bye!!
10502     Great organization tool. Love the &#34;tagging&#34; feature.
4057      I really enjoy this app, its very reliable and easy to use.  I especially like that it is web based and i can start and stop a note anytime.
5218      I really wanted a note system I could trust, but Evernote just lost all my notes on the upgrade.
6639      I love the notebooks feature which allows me to organize the notes I take.  I hate keeping paper so I am able to take a picture of a document inside my notes and then discard the document.
4281      I love Evernote. It has become my hub for all my workflow and projects. I have a lot invested in this app, including going on my third year of paid subscription.

However, this latest version for iOS is unusable. The UI is confusing, and it crashes a lot. I am constantly placing notes in the wrong notebook because of the confusing layout.

I really really hope they fix this soon. As for the time being, I cannot recommend the iOS version at all.
8822      I like the idea to access my notes everywhere including my iPhone.

But the user interface is not very user friendly. Notes look messy especially when editing both on my phone and the desktop version.

UPDATE:
Last release broke sync! Now I am used to see bugs in Evernote but this release makes it simply unusable. I need sync.
4172      Messy and disorganized looking main screen. 
You have to hunt to add a new notebook - should be more intuitive and user friendly especially for such an easy task. Add a plus sign! Boom, done. 
Please streamline and clean up the format. 
Functionality and sharing is great, but needs a facelift for sure. Keep it simple people.
9766      I use this for all my lists and for some reason, I like using  it more than the outlook task lists- I can use this and update it from my PC - It&#39;s simply more appealing.
4994      I love this app. Evernote is my best friend. I can&#39;t even use it anymore. The new redesign is nice, I like it but the organization and function of the app has gone down a little. 

Now it doesn&#39;t even work. It won&#39;t open my notes, it freezes all the time. Everything this app promotes and provides has gone kit the window. Please fix this.
11749     I usually love this app but why on earth would one release an update that makes the application crash when starting? Aren&#39;t there any tests being made before offering it to the entire world?! And this is both iPhone and iPad. Please fix!
7149      Great app to keep active lists you want to share or keep for yourself. Perfect for saving links and web info in one easy to use place.
5739      This is by far the best productivity app around.  Using the methods described in thesecretweapon.org, EN has helped me get my act together.  Highly recommend!!!!!!
3908      The latest update ruined it.  The new UI is no longer intuitive nor easy to use; buttons to search notes or add a new note are small and tucked away in corners of the screen.  The new version of the app is slow and takes 30 seconds until I can even input a new note. When I try to take a photo as a note, the app crashes. This never used to happen. I see absolutely nothing in this new version that qualifies as an improvement on the app that I used to love. Instead, they ruined it.
5582      Evernote makes my life so much simpler with its ability to use for so many applications and it crosses over between different devices and everything you use is all in one place when you go pick it up or use it. And I really love that they&#39;re always trying to improve upon it that&#39;s a great thing keep it up!!!!
6573      It took me about 4 months before I started to understand the power of Evernote; the more you use it, the more powerful it becomes. 

I publish a magazine, am the editor of a newsletter and the assistant editor for a third newsletter. Evernote helps me keep all three projects separated but organized. Using Stacks, each issue is outlined, and using the internal links, I am able to hyperlink to articles sent by writers, photographers, etc.

Beyond writing, I use Evernote to keep family photographs, Halloween costume ideas, a collection of inspirational quotes, a morgue of photography poses, and oodles of articles I find on the &#39;net. 

ProTip: Learn to love tags and stacks.

My beefs: I would love to see at least one more level of Stacks. There is feature that transcribes audio notes recorded in Evernote. It works fine for short notes. However, imported audio notes do not seem to work.
6239      It&#39;s a great app, works perfectly with my iPad and Bluetooth keyboard. Very easy to learn how to do everything. 95% satisfied after 2 weeks. However, with all the apps Evernote has (Hello, Food, etc) I would&#39;ve already gladly paid for Premium if it weren&#39;t for only two choices of &#34;plans&#34; of monthly &amp; yearly; how about one time payment??? This app is very good but it&#39;s not great. Has to be a little more user friendly, especially for the iPad. I don&#39;t like that that I can&#39;t change highlighter color to something better than weird orange and I don&#39;t like that I can&#39;t change the size of font in my notebook documents past the paragraph presets. Would gladly pay for Premium if it wasn&#39;t just monthly/yearly
9755      Draft your ideas and sync across devices!  It rocks. Mac, PC, iPhone, Chromebook, and web!  Then publish!
9303      I use it every day, very easy
5611      Fix it now!
9759      I&#39;d love a cleaner, more refined interface.  Otherwise a really great tool.
7103      I love this app!  I use it multiple times a day for both personal and work items. I am now even using it as my daily journal. It truly is an extension of my brain!
5758      Adding to the &#34;eye strain&#34; that is iOS7...this update looks/feels terrible.
9938      Whether its from my iPhone, desktop, or laptop (all Apple), this works seamlessly and without a hitch. My notes are always here, via wifi or 3G. No complaints! I love it!
12359     when note is large, screen doesn&#39;t display characters while typing!  when are they gonna fix this problem?  no way to submit bug reports???
5078      I use multiple machines. PC, iPhone, iPad, work PC on a corporate firewall. I used to have to email documents so that i can move and share them between machines. Now i put the document in Evernote. For example  at the end of a meeting i take a picture of the whiteboard with my personal phone and by the time i get back to my desk the notes are available at my corporate pc. I also use it to share documents with colleagues. For  example, i receive a resume via email, i upload to an Evernote folder right from outlook to be reviewed. And someone else reviews or interviews the person and rights their comments along with the resume.  This is a very useful productivity tool. There are other use cases. 
I recommend it to all my friends all my employees use it as well.
6693      I love Evernote this is my favorite app.  I use it for everything from my recipes to my creative ideas, pic. You name it and it is there. Love it !!!!
10199     I love Evernote, so this app gets a lot of mileage on my iPad. Wish it ran faster (esp. on my iPad Gen. 1) and wish it contained more full-editing capabilities (I can&#39;t find how to input a horizontal line). But those nits aside, one of my fav apps.
6648      How many apps can you say THAT about? Bt yeah, the perfect depository for almost any and everything I need to remember. If hey increase their &#39;reminder&#39; functionality? I&#39;ll need to lobby iTunes to allow for a special 6th star for Evernote!
6493      Love having one place to go for all my thoughts, notes, clips, pics, recipes, you name it! And great search!
6503      good
6245      amazing
3866      Latest update results in a crash every time I open it.  Please fix.
4969      Can&#39;t use on 4s with iOS 7. Freezes upon opening and can&#39;t use the app at all. Plus the new app is super confusing and difficult to use when it works on iPad. A massive step in the wrong direction.
8557      Great product, I use this for note taking and it has been critical for my success. Love this app.....
9622      One of the most effective and fluid apps for taking notes in class. Updates on my desktop computer where I can edit my notes, add information from text and print from my desktop computer. The computer app that accompanies the app has a clean user interface. The best is that I can HIGHLIGHT. I am able to move and edit my notes with ease. Would like to have an arrow key so I can Great app!
4044      Very useful!
4638      iOS7 problems fixed. Back to being an excellent program.
5526      I can&#39;t say enough about EverNote. I use it to keep track of my life. I use it to run meetings, remember notes, save blogs, and much more. Also since it automatically syncs to all of my devices I always have all my notes and information with me.
9284      Very functional, useful app. Love the journal companion app.
8712      .
4710      Freezes on start, unusable.
7583      Great tool...  Use it daily
8059      My new electronic &#34;moleskine&#34;.
10687     I love evernote on my mac, but the iPad version does include directory support and is clunky.  The interface needs to be like the mac version, or at least we should have the option!!
8801      Use it so much for my ministry...love the opportunity to make as many notebooks as necessary and to send articles via email.
8375      Finally, the most important feature added last. Why were Reminders not added earlier?
5681      I use evernote for most of my note taking, but now I have to pay 5 dollars a month just for a slightly longer note? Ridiculous!
10971     Great note application, I just love the app, makes my life easy.

Evernote, you rock!!!!!!!!
8102      It&#39;s good for keeping notes who would of thought.
4376      When I open the app it&#39;s not smooth as it used to be. It&#39;s very buggy and performance isn&#39;t too good. Looking forward for a fix
5620      I really like the new version of Evernote and it&#39;s very helpful when I&#39;m trying to take notes and writing my assignment. The option to bold, italicize, and underline along with adding bullets and numbers is very useful. However, when I try to tab while using bullets to make a smaller category under that bullet, it doesn&#39;t convert that particular bullet to say, an open circle or a square like in the previous version. I would love it if you guys changed that! Otherwise, I&#39;m sticking with four stars.
12290     So handy love it. I use it on Mac and iPhone as they have a desktop app too. ????????????????????????????????????????????????????
8622      ...almost. 

Every piece of paper that enter my house is now scanned straight into evernote. Everything is automatically OCRed by evernote so I can search through them. That receipt from 3 years ago? Got it in less than a second. All contracts, all documents, everything that I used to spend time on filling is now available everywhere within seconds. Even my kids now scan their homework.
6579      My creative juices can flow anytime, anywhere and I&#39;ve got the tool to capture it all!
10303     Integrates well with iPhone 5 speech to text for a useful dictation tool for my law practice.
8745      I already own Penultimate and have kept it up to date. I&#39;ve tried Evernote at various times, same with Penultimate, but there isn&#39;t an intuitive start-up instructions on integrating the two; at least not that I&#39;ve found.  That&#39;s the principal problem with all iOS programs. And the App Store is ZERO help. I could keep going, but Apple owns these and probably won&#39;t put this up under the program rating.  Additionally, the In-App offerings don&#39;t make sense and I have a post graduate degree from UC.
6422      Between this and omnifocus, my organization needs are met.
11913     I updated Evernote on my iPad and now it wont open!  :(
10951     Evernote will change your life if you let. I use it for everything.
8503      it does exactly what it says it will do, basically, so I&#39;m very satisfied. I like to take a lot of notes, and this allows me to store them in a server as opposed to thousands of notebooks I&#39;ll never look back at. I can easily bring my notes with me everywhere, since I have Evernote stored on my iPhone. Overall, very satisfied. I also like the new layout as well.
6277      I have the verasu targus case with a keyboard and use this app for taking notes in class. Taking pictures of my worksheets are easy. Typing and organizing my notebooks are also simple. In combine with switch its perfect! The secret to getting it to show up as a picture instead of the link is upload the picture as a new note in switch and then same to your camera roll. Then you can open it in combine with written notes on the pages.  Once I figured that out its been a breeze.
6687      I use this app everyday and every moment.
8104      I use Evernote all the time. I love it
5505      Did the update (I had to with the new phone) and subsequently lost all my notes, including a mailbox code. Not cool...
5658      I have been looking for the perfect app for note-taking and organization for years, and I am happy to say that my quest is over. I have had Evernote on my iPhone and iPad for a long time, but never really gave it a try because of its simple look and feel. Sounds strange I know. I am now using Evernote exclusively for these tasks on my iPhone, iPad, iMac, and MacBook Air, and I love it. I don&#39;t know how I lived without the syncing and power of this app. Thanks Evernote.
7493      This is a great app for organizing information for work, I have made a notebook for all of my customers. I keep notes in each about every phone call and anything else related to customer. Very useful
3760      Evernote really is an incredible product. Been a user now for 4 years and with each updated release the user experience gets worse and worse. I used to enjoy hopping into Evernote to drop / gather ideas, now its a chore. Still hesitantly choppy, aesthetically ugly, buggy with screen freezes and unforced close outs. I simply have to much invested to leave and hope future releases will improve.
9410      I started using Evernote way back in October 2004 when the very first beta version was offered for public testing. It was not a web app back then - I don&#39;t think there were many of those, if any, at that point in Internet history. I was a big fan of Evernote then. However when the official release was made and payment was required I decided to stop using Evernote. The initial price for beta testers was kind of high IMO. I remember there was an email sent out by the &#34;Evernote Powers That Be&#34; stating that Evernote&#39;s primary market would be tablet users who needed the ability to enter handwritten notes and have them recognized as text; thus the pricing was a bit high. Since I didn&#39;t fall into that demographic I sadly ended my relationship with Evernote. However it wasn&#39;t long before the price dropped - probably a promotional discount that was lower than the original offering to beta testers - and so I jumped on it. I have been an Evernote user ever since!

Like many early Evernote users I was not very happy with the early releases of Evernote 3; most of the advanced features that had made Evernote  the top choice among power note-taking users were abandoned and in their place was universal access via the so-called &#34;cloud&#34; and especially mobile devices. While I fully understand the economic benefits to Evernote, it was still painful to say &#34;good-bye&#34; to the &#34;old&#34; Evernote. But the new Evernote has turned out to be a rousing success! Though I still miss a lot of the features that were in previous versions of Evernote I am fully enjoying the new incarnation of Evernote! I&#39;ve been a Premium subscriber since the subscription concept was instituted and plan to keep it that way for as long as Evernote and I are around!

I fully endorse and recommend Evernote as highly as possible to anyone and everyone who uses a computer, mobile device, or both!

Thank you,

Jim
8668      I use it for everything! Thanks!
5316      Okay Evernote, I hope you are listening. You had a great idea. But &#34;note&#34; should not be in your name. Call it Eversomething. The text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text, bullets, numbered lists, indentation, etc. Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting. I don&#39;t know, but until this is fixed it is not useful. And man I&#39;ve really tried to like Evernote. The synching ability among so many platforms was great. But I have to go back to OneNote now. Who knows if you will read this. But I really wish you would understand this huge weakness in your product. And I have done a good amount of googling around to know that I&#39;m not the only one around wanting better text capabilities. Please fix this. I really want / need a proper Evernote!
7696      BEST FOR NOTES, IDEAS, ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAVE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. ON SIGHT.
11683     Won&#39;t work since newest update. Please fix
11541     Bad,bad,bad......and BADDDDD !  Crash, crash and CRASHHHH!
11984     If you want to get things done, get this app.
3643      I have mistakenly deleted or copied over important notes.  Wish there was undo/redo options!!!
9729      This is the perfect app for organization
8718      I use this app on my Mac, iPad, iPhone and work Mac and it keeps me sane. I love it and how flexible and versatile it is. Some small crashes but nothing that is out of the ordinary for big apps. Love it.
8298      Wins!
9855      Outstanding tool for organizing customer information and keeping track of site visits.  Also use it during training seminars &amp; sales meetings, then share the note with my colleagues.  Very easy!
5865      Can&#39;t sync in iOS 7 iphone app. It upgraded my database and now I see only 2 notes. iPad version works though. Manual sync does nothing too.
7201      Love this app! Seriously, it is saving my life with this amazingly organized elephant. I find everything, can save everything from computer and have it always handy. Absolutely perfect. An idea is that I would like to have some notebooks in one bigger notebook. Other than that, so far, I love it. Thank you!
7453      I&#39;m a contractor and I use this app for just about everything imaginable. Estimates, general notes to self, supply lists, receipts, etc. love this app!
6702      Great App! Could use a function for  re-prioritizing Folder order.
11493     I had lots of notes and just updated this app, and erased ALL of them.  I just lost so much data.  I&#39;m upset with myself for relying on an app instead of something more trustworthy like Notes.
12023     In general I am an Evenote fan and it does what I need while syncing to multiple devices. For me it has been a consistently indispensable  tool. However, the interface is still quite awkward. Cut and paste is slow and adding tags is tedious. I wish there were a better way to add notes while surfing on the iPad.
10221     I absolutely love this app. Looks nice and clean and is very simple to use. The developer did awesome work.
11903     I&#39;ve just updated to the new 5.2 version, and I can&#39;t open the app anymore! 
Fix it urgent!
6894      I love Evernote, I use it for college classes, meeting notes, planning my wedding and more, but lately when I type the note keeps scrolling down every time I type something. This makes the app almost unusable. PLEASE fix this!
10419     So multi-functional. Can be used for so many different tasks, jobs, careers.
3628      Best note app I&#39;ve used. Need web clipper for Chrome on iPhone, but still love it.
8011      Good interface. Easy to use.  Lots of organizational options for notes including pictures, voice and notes.
4723      Deleted.
5690      New design is strange to navigate, tag lookup is slow, unintuitive is a pretty good word for some of the changes.
5885      Korean keyboard error..
please.. fix it.. 

I use it very frequently..
9095      I have been using Evernote for a while and then using it more and more all the time.  I&#39;m sure that I don&#39;t know how to fully utilize it. I was logging in just to say how great I thought its search function was but offer some ideas on improvement. But then I read all the recent one star ratings and was dismayed. Somehow I missed all this password catastrophe (so far) and I can get to my stuff just fine but I&#39;m dismayed about what has happened and very afraid to continue using it. I do see a few recommendations for replacement of Evernote. I&#39;ll keep an eye on the reviews to see what ideas appear. Many thanks to all of you folks who have taken the time to alert the rest of us.
11633     Please hurry with a fix for the update so I can go back to rating this app with 5 stars. I can&#39;t believe this happened AGAIN, with the app crashing the minute I open it. The last time this happened, I signed up for 2 other apps &amp; saved my notes on them. However, once Evernote was back in action, I was lulled into thinking they had gotten their act together--now THIS disaster! Please don&#39;t make me switch apps permanently...
10995     Just excellent!!!! For personal, work, projects.
11866     It keeps crashing out on my ipad3.  Not even usable now.
4404      Great evernote client to accompany the web.  Well Done. Must have You can do everything on the app that you can online.  5 stars for sure
9361      AWESOME!!!!!! I use it for everything.
7663      I have been using several other apps for my notes, but none was so easy to use across PC, Mac, iPad and, yes, even Blackberry.

After the last upgrade I started using Skitch.  At the beginning I had doubts about moving to a second app to edit PDFs; but no more.  Its quite fluid and works very well.  I even liked the fact that I could edit the PDF and then go back to Evernote for actual notes without having to quite the PDF.

The only couple of things is that I still miss the Stacking in the iOS version and no editing in shared notebooks.

Other than that, It&#39;s a great App
10259     This has become one of my favorite apps.  It is so nice to have everything in one place and to be able to find it when you need to.  Well Done!
8937      This app keeps me sane! I love that I can use it on my computer, my tablet, and my phone. Respect the necessity of awesome list-making!
3787      Thank for fixing the probs with 7.2.0
I rely on Evernote !
9432      Really useful. Love it!
11404     I can&#39;t log into my Evernote.  And all my school notes are on Evernote. It also can&#39;t find Evernote servers.
6350      Gotta love it.
8630      I use this for so many things. I take notes in meetings, training, phone calls...they all go in Evernote. I have multiple clients and I have a notebook on everyone of them. I share notes with my employees, friends and clients. I even have notebooks for new recipes, health tips, and for my hobbies. I used to fill up 12 notebooks a year and then when I needed to find something I would have to flip thru multiple notebooks to find that notation. Not anymore. I do a quick search and voila... I have the note at my fingertips in seconds. :)
12385     It will not allow me to create an acct. 
nice!
10487     I would be completely lost without this app. now that I&#39;ve discovered how to use it. I was using an electronic cookbook software on my desktop. The search feature in Evernote is more powerful - all recipe changes can be modified right on my iPhone and I can easy attach a photo and email directly into Evernote (easy to add Evernote as a contact). It also helps me track all the gifts I buy throughout the year for my large family.  I take a photo with my iPhone,  tag it with their name and email it right from the store. Now I have the information with me and I don&#39;t forget who I bought for - and what. I can&#39;t imagine my life without it.
11394     The new update complicated my day. I can&#39;t log into my account, and Evernote won&#39;t send me the email to reset the password. Great.
8703      Downloaded this app after reading about it in the 4HWW and it really put my life in order. I would also suggest a good calendar app for anyone looking for ever more organization.
4690      This app is full of issues, and smells like a &#34;design for the sake of design&#34; kind of project.

Here&#39;s the things which I find most irritating:

#Paying to arrange the home screen 

I need to see ads (&#34;announcements&#34; and &#34;market&#34;) in my face  unless I pay? Terrible. Evernote was founded on the principle of &#34;here&#39;s a great app, and you can pay to make it better&#34;. This is &#34;here&#39;s an annoying app, pay to make it ok&#34;.

#Audio capture is hard

Quick note doesn&#39;t include audio, which seems natural on a mobile device on which typing is hard. Instead, recording audio is a major hassle that requires several clicks and sub menus.

#Places is badly implemented

Places is a great thing in theory - see your notes on a map. In practice, the screen area dedicated to the map is so small it&#39;s borderline unusable, and seeing all my notes on the same map is useless. I need some context, like showing only points from a certain notebook or tag.

#But that&#39;s not all

The app is full of little usability issues. Fancy animations with a lot less substance than you&#39;d expect from Evernote.

I will update this review when the app changes.

6303      I really enjoy using Evernote and it is one of the apps I use most often on my Mac, iPad, and iPhone. I use it for taking notes in college and also for personal journal entries. My one gripe with this version of Evernote is that when I try to use it on my iPhone, there seems to be some sort of error that makes the screen keep scrolling down until I am unable to type anymore. If that was fixed, this review would be 5 stars, no doubt
12138     Seems useful. Still figuring out how to set it up though.
7635      Wow! Love how easy it is to use. Simple and straight forward. Love it.
11818     Thanks for snippet view -- looks great on iPhone 4 and iPad 4!  I had same problem with crashing that others describe on the iPhone -- deleting the app and reinstalling from App Store fixed the problem. I also like the new side-swiping for the PDF reader rather than scrolling. Good update to a great product!
6236      Being multi-device is good.
The search is good.
The outlining could be better - ability to fold/close sub-bullet points would be great.
Not great as a task manager, but good for notes.
4195      I was a big fan, became a premium member and have had nothing but problems since. Losing data consistently. They&#39;ve ruined a good app.
9872      Great
8226      The addition of reminders has made an already awesome app even &#34;awesomer!&#34;
10670     I literally use for everything.
6502      Don&#39;t know what id do without Evernote - hands down favorite app.
9390      Love this software. I have store hours, lumber prices, handyman chore lists, vacation plans, mortgage info, woodworking ideas from the web, lists of product details for things like my furnace filter, rollerblade wheel size, hem length, printer ink, vacuum bag size, etc. I even have my license plate numbers for my cars. I use it everyday. I like I can get at all this in on my phone and computer and the automatically synch.  On your computer there is even a right click feature to clip the web page on screen to EverNote. Niiiiiiiice.
7126      The only problem I have is that the app is no longer updating for my iOS. Oh well at least I can still use my current version, for that you lose a star.
7879      I have been using Evernote since its early implementations: it has become an indispensable tool for my personal, professional and work life. It is misleading to characterize it as a note-taking application. If there is a current technique for extended one&#39;s mind, it is by far Evernote.
9985      I love Evernote! It&#39;s great for organizing my life. I no longer search for random pieces of paper with notes scribbled. But, I really wish it allowed hand written notes. Sometimes it&#39;s more convenient than typing, especially when taking notes on existing documents.
12276     Devs got rid of list view for some insane reason and now app is no longer a productivity helper for many.
12297     I used Evernote to store my bookings, flight tickets and other critical traveling info. But when I crossed the border of my country, I found that my notes are no longer available because free version does not support &#34;offline&#34; files and I didn&#39;t have Wifi available at hand. How can you even release a piece of software without such critical feature? 
Why don&#39;t they write this anywhere on the main page? This raises false premises for users.

Fortunately my wife had a copy of all the records in her laptop, otherwise I would have been screwed by Evernote in a foreign country.

Dont use Evernote for anything but bogus notes, or pay them monthly for nothing.
Will never use this piece of crapware again.
6870      Shares exact location. I hate this app
7091      Got this app to open one time otherwise, it&#39;s on the loading screen forever. So far, a waste of time and space on my phone. Disappointed.
9819      Moss prtg loves this app n
8085      Having the Evernote program on the computer &amp; the app on my phone is so great. Makes business so much easier. I absolutely love this app &amp; software!!!!
3655      I love Evernote; however, I just agreed to leave feedback and now it won&#39;t let me return to the app. Hoping it&#39;s just user ignorance. :)
8901      See title.
8884      Is anybody home??
10175     Although Evernote is indispensable, it needs some simple capabilities, such as word/letter count and clean HTML5 export.
4278      I don&#39;t know why they screwed up themselves. I wanna roll back 4.x version.
4134      I have used Evernote as my Getting Things Done tool for a year. It&#39;s remarkably flexible and full-featured. My quibble is that Evernote launches slowly on the iPhone 4. When I want to make a quick note, or take a picture of my parking space so I&#39;ll remember, I don&#39;t want to wait for 30 seconds before I can do anything. 

Other than that issue, this is a great app that syncs perfectly among my iPhone, iPad, my desktop Mac at home, and my Windows machine at work. That&#39;s an accomplishment.
8451      This is my extended memory, a seamless extension of my brain!
Work or play - my notes are in here. Keeps all my stuff nicely in sync across my iPad, iPhone and Mac.
I take all my notes in Evernote (duh!) as well as scans/snapshots of all my important documents.
10844     Incredible app!! Thank you!
7889      I love it evernote
5850      Just installed on my 5s, app won&#39;t open and stay open. Constantly closes after clicking the icon. Cannot even use it at this point.
8934      Love this app for organizing notes! The audio recording is awesome! I enjoy the word doc and pdf management abilities. Have be use this app a couple of years now.
5338      I never knew something this good could exist! I can&#39;t believe how clean the interface is, and how well everything works. I have had zero sync issues!
6415      Syncs to everything, i don&#39;t know what i would do without it...
4115      No more, no less, but i guess is a good option for what&#39;s out there.
11400     Everything was great until the recent update password lost my notes. I can&#39;t find them anywhere. I had synced some earlier notes, but the most recent ones from the last few weeks are all gone. How do I get them back.
8705      Great app!
6691      Love Evernote. Use it all the time. Wish all my apps were this good. Recommend it to all my friends.
7067      Si sientes que tienes un prop?sito en la vida, esta es tu mejor herramienta para cumplir tus sue?os. Carlos Andr?s gallego
11484     It used to be good but then it asked for me to sign in, and when I signed I lost all notes from school. There was a lot of notes. I would give it a lower rating but 1 star is as low as it gets
10736     I heard about this app on CBT Nuggets and I am learning new things about it all the time. 
I love the checkboxes for my To Do lists and I am looking forward to unleashing other possibilities. 

I use it regularly for  note taking when I am reading books etc.
11869     After installing last update I can&#39;t open application any more. Before update was working like a charm, hope the application will be soon on and running againg.
6793      Think better and live fuller
6575      Use it to help me keep tabs on things I need to take action on or follow up.
9914      I love this app, but i do wish i could resize images i paste. I use this a lot with Anatomy and Physiology and if i post pics i would like to resize the images within the app. other than that..this is a great and awsome app
7877      Great for web snagging and note taking
11083     The ability to be paperless with standardized concept that allows personalization makes Evernote my one stop shop. If it can be scanned, emailed, moved from a application, copied from the web or photographed, I have those items in my notebooks. The ability to use Evernote across multiple devices makes it extremely valuable to me. Presently I have it on the iPhone, iPad and Mac and they work perfectly together.
9362      I am a premium evernote user. Have been using for 3 years now. Finally a home organizer that doesn&#39;t go belly up after I get my notes in it. It&#39;s the main reason I bought the iPhone. Only downside is the inability to edit multimedia or rich notes. It&#39;s also good for storing unix commands. New version works with rich notes. Note change you can now edit non text notes with iPad version.
8410      Great for keeping organized and coordinating with colleagues.
9189      I love how Evernote puts all my stuff in one place.  There are a couple of things I wish it did.  I wish it used the autocorrect functions that other apps on iPhone and iPad have.  That would make typing go so much faster.  I also wish it would allow me to put the cursor anywhere on the screen like you can do in the desktop application.
8887      I have loved this app for a long time and use it frequently. However, beginning today it immediately crashes as soon as I open it. This is very disappointing as I have information I need to access/add. Please fix this!
6947      I like this app so far, especially the radio buttons that you can create to indicate that a task is completed.  Wish it had a task list function though.
12030     Works well on MacBook and iPhone. On iPad, keeps telling me synchronization failed for a note that doesn&#39;t exist. Very annoying.
7625      Life alteringly awesome.
7929      I literally use this app for everything. Out of all the other note apps that I have discovered and tried Evernote is the only one that I feel I can rely on for being there on my phone and computer in sync. It keeps track of where I am and what&#39;s in my Calander and makes notes accordingly which I greatly appreciate. The simplicity and user friendliness is in matched when it comes to Evernote!
5763      I used Evernote years ago when it first came out but had to stop because I kept getting burned. I would take extensive notes on my phone and the sync would fail and delete everything I typed.  I stopped using it for a few years and gave it another shot hoping newer versions would be better. Nope.  Doesn&#39;t happen all the time, but it should never happen.
8953      Excellent app.  Highly recommend.
5659      Delete and reinstall if your notes don&#39;t sync. Only 16 of hundreds pulled down on my initial install. 

A little too green for me but I like the flatness.
4256      Even though I updated evernote, there still exits bugs. When I typing in Korean, it is impossible to write correctly. I think there is time?? delay..
11092     It would be 5 stars although it seem more difficult than it should be to change different formatting or continue notes by going into the middle of the body of the text. ( seems sluggish on activating text editor )
5793      I love evernote, however with the new version there are some features removed (or broken) on the iPad.  I am guessing this is just an iOS7 issue.

You can no longer create titles or subsections.  Also once you bold or italicize text you can not undo that without removing the paragraph formatting.  Lastly, spellcheck doesnt seem to be working right.  Not sure what is happening there.

I am a paid evernote customer, and I love the app, but these broken features are a bit disappointing.
7290      This is a really great way to take notes. Can&#39;t imagine going back to pad and pen.
8168      Evernote brought me out of the dark age of pen and paper.  I love the granularity you can build to organize your notes and other important information.  The search tool rocks. You can share notes and access. And it is with you everywhere: MacBook, iPad and iPhone. Which is so great for those unexpected runs to the tea shop to get your wife her favorite blend. What kinda was that again?
Do yourself a favor though. Buy the premium version and show so love to he Evernote gang for the awesome product they created.
8978      Use it every day love it
4920      Prior to the latest update, Evernote was very clear and visually organized. Now, it&#39;s not syncing with my camera role and the layout is too visually stimulating.  What a bummer!
11519     I use Evernote on a daily basis, know my password from using it on my iPad, iPhone and PC. Still, for some reason I&#39;m not able to log in to Evernote today, and when I try to reset my account, I get a prompt stating my user name doesn&#39;t exist - not good. Please help! I use this for work a lot and have several important project notes on my account :(
11312     I&#39;m confused. The upgrade on 3/2 (I think) was also a password reset upgrade, which I did. Now I have to reset again, 4 days later? I&#39;ll hold off until further clarified. Sheesh, what a pain!
9904      This is my most trusted app on the phone. Walking down the street see something I like and take a picture... Find a website with details I want to remember use the web clipper... Emails I don&#39;t want to lose use the email forwarding. My favorite though is being able to read an article on Pulse save it and have it automatically sync. Great for the water cooler wars.
6481      Wonderful app!
8589      Great app. Indispensable.
3770      And crush sometime
7656      Awesome!
4743      Very confusing IU!
9360      It is not immediately obvious how Evernote fits into one&#39;s life, but it gets clear with use. Spend the time and you won&#39;t regret it.
9137      Great app!
5412      Nice app,handful
9659      Never forget again!
7394      Crashes every time I try to open it! Useless!! Would give 0 stars if possible!
9006      I write fiction, and EN has allowed me to make notes, write stories on the fly, read and edit my work. The only issue is formatting when dumping the stories into Word and back. I blame Microsoft. More formatting options inside EN would make this app perfect. I&#39;d pay for those features.
10212     Allows me to keep track of ideas, thoughts, projects, to-do&#39;s, notes, etc immediately. Now if I can only get it to remember names for me...
5896      I use it for business and personal use every single week.
4801      This version:
-made a decent UI into a MESS
-search is now hidden?!
-among top tier items on UI are now announcements and marketplace? Why?
-why did u remove styles in note editing? That was THE BEST feature of the previous version. 
-what&#39;s with the 4-8 seconds of non-responsiveness?
-touch-and-hold-cursor magnifying glass is unusable
-do u guys test your software before you put it out?
-you&#39;re rewarding developers for developing things to work WITH Evernote when EVERNOTE doesn&#39;t work?! Cut that crap and refocus- get your #1 right: Evernote
-the only thing I like in the whole app is the addition of left center and right justify.
-I&#39;m a premium user and I WILL NOT renew until y&#39;all get this right!
11423     Too many updates lately, now on this recent one, I find my account documents are all gone. Definitely NOT RELIABLE!!!
11112     It would be 5 stars if the OCR worked better.
5635      I generally don&#39;t take time up write reviews, but this is a must have app. 

Beautiful new interface and great functionality across my Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Huge boost to productivity. Thanks, Evernote team.
9373      Super for families
9047      Great app
12419     I can synch my notes from iPhone to PC to iPad. Great product!!!
Outstanding app! Very stable and consistent across platforms.
4619      BUT this app constantly crashes and freezes!!!! It irritates me cause it freezes for a LONG time and the crashes are ANNOYING. It also doesn&#39;t show me how many days I have left in my monthly cycle of memory anymore :( Please fix that!!! I constantly have to sign into Evernote in Safari just to check, and that takes a LONG time. I have Evernote in iOS 7 for the iPhone 4.
7122      This is very nice and easy to use! I also love the syncing to my Mac. I now have to explore all the available functions.
11234     I&#39;m no man of big words but this app is really usefull.
7504      PLEASE modify app to highlight most recent changes if notebook is edited by more than one user. Or allow font color edits in iPhone and iPad apps. Very difficult to recognize small changes between users.
7118      I love taking notes on paper, but the reality of it is that I need to eventually type them up, and I need them all the time, anywhere I go. With Evernote, it&#39;s so easy to have my notes every time I need them :)
9546      Love it!!
5061      The older, pull tab interface was much better. This new UI is ugly and hard to use. Also, it&#39;s much slower. Really hard to find things. Takes too long to enter a quick note.
5642      Used to be one of my essential app on my iphone.  The latest version does not work at all.
11686     My least favorite part about the new version is that it crashes when it opens. My favorite part about the new version is that it crashes when it opens. Really, that&#39;s about all it does now.
4427      Forget this app and use &#34;Notesuite&#34; by far better and no monthly fees. You won&#39;t be disappointed!!!
11360     Ever since the update, I cannot get evernote to load on my ipad.  I am with everyone else here, evernote needs to get there act together and fix the problem.
9195      I love it.
7699      I love to write. Inspiration for words can come at the drop of a hat which why I absolutely love this app. I have the ability to record thoughts at my finger tips by having the app on my phone then can go back and work on the same pieces on my computer later at home. The instant syncing between computer and phone is fantastic!
It&#39;s perfect for writing, recipes, or absolutely anything really. Very satisfied!
9473      I&#39;m a writer, and Evernote is a great resource and tool I use to capture and organize my ideas.  I love having a notebook dedicated to each book.  Evernote&#39;s simple and easy interface makes organization smooth and effortless.

I don&#39;t use it for my actual writing, though.  Evernote doesn&#39;t replace Pages or Word for me.  But for ideas it is fantastic.  :)
9846      How dirty! Who are you to say that I need to change my password! Especially since I was already creating a l-o-n-g note. Interrupted my work flow and then lost my note after changing my password!!!!!!!!!!!!!

...and you call this &#34;EVERnote&#34; ? Should be &#34;NEvER NOTE&#34;!
 I&#39;d laugh but I am too busy cursing!

Waste of an entire morning... switching to another note taking app then deleting this app once I have time to transfer remaining notes to &#34;ELSEWHERE&#34; note app!!!!
8486      I&#39;ve been using Evernote for years on other devices. Having it on iPad is very useful. It just keeps getting better.
4604      Ugh! I used to love Evernote and used it constantly. Not anymore. The last updates have made it a clunky design, not to mention incredibly slow. So slow that it&#39;s easier and faster for me to write notes by hand! Please improve!!
8819      Good
10361     Great app.  iPhone,iPad and PC all sync perfectly.
5207      Won&#39;t even open. Exploring alternatives now. Too bad, as this was quite useful until this update.
11200     All I use have premium account offline syncing for flights. Nice having notes in one area.
10416     Great
7765      Keeps getting better. Can&#39;t be used enough. Great job.
11849     Can&#39;t open Evernote since update 02-28-13
3769      I like it. I put everything in Evernote and sync across my devices
9317      I am completely dependent on/committed to Evernote, and I use the iPad app very day, but as another reviewer noted, I really wish it were more like the Windows desktop app because of how I&#39;ve set up my tags.
4897      Evernote has far exceeded any expectation I had!
10424     There is nothing like it. I use it everyday, for EVERYTHING. Get it, use it, love it, review it so other will too!
8073      Love it!
6845      Copy and paste is clunky: one word or the whole page on the iPad
Font between devices is clunky: you change it on one but the other device does something different 
I wish the look between iPad and computer were the same
Recently the numerous choices of colored font was removed. There are four colors now plus black and gray. 
The paid app price is too high
I like the notebook way of organizing documents
12424     A great app for taking notes on the go.
11218     I&#39;ve never written a review til now, tried to reset password - but the app has looked me out because I can&#39;t remember 5 words in my notes...I don&#39;t use this app everyday or every week for that matter, so I don&#39;t remember what words were used...should I just keep guessing!  I have some photos on there I can&#39;t retrieve now. As far as I&#39;m concerned I&#39;ll never use or recommend evernote to anyone!

Ticked-Off!
8019      Learn to use the camera and page camera for notes. Awesome.
9929      Not quite as intuitive as I hoped it would be but after getting the hang of it I like it!
8380      I record everything - Evernote is a wonderful way to archive everything you do on a daily basis through text, images and audio. PLEASE give us the option to select a higher quality recording.
9485      Just. Awesome...With Awesome sauce.
9791      It needs to work on being integrated with some of the other browsers to avoid a daisy-chain process to get items into Evernote, but once the information gets there it is easy to find, tag, search, organize. Tags could use a word cloud function.
7608      Couldn&#39;t sync iPhone and iPad . No response from tech support.
Logged out of iPad and when I logged in all my notes were gone.
I gave this one star because no stars was not an option.
10055     This app has been perfect for note taking. My only wish is that they make it possible to return to the last page I was on Shen I open the app after a break.
11877     Which means I can&#39;t get to my business notes. Help!!
9797      Try and open the app and it tries to resort some of my entries and crashes. Afterwards I try and open again and it asks to send a report, but then crashes. This loop is never ending....
12274     I have been using EN for a few months and really like the fact that you can record while taking notes and then have that available across different devices.  I do agree with some of the other reviews that it is a bit clunky and confusing at times when you go back to edit. Don&#39;t love the new format - miss the list view of my notes  Overall a good app.
6817      I must say this is one of my most used and favorite app. I use it for every occasion. Would be lost without it, thanks!!!!!
7971      I use Evernote for everything from GTD to drafting writing projects. It does everything so well!
4731      Since latest upgrade camera causes app to shut down.
6407      Way ahead of similar apps!!
5698      Pls fix asap
5869      In iOS 7 on a 3rd-gen iPad, latest Evernote displays only six of my 35 notes. Clicking the title of any of the visible notes brings up an entirely different note. Sort function does not work.
9264      Love access from any platform. Great.
4059      This program is the best way to keep notes across different platforms.  Easy to search and retrieve information.  Nothing fancy -- it just works.
8054      I have been Evernote-ing my life. 

I don&#39;t think I could live without it.
8244      The single most important app on my phone and my computer.
6360      This app is one you won&#39;t delete. Very, very useful as a storage place for important docs and spur of the moment  brilliant ideas.  Love Love Love this app!!!!
8129      Almost a 5 star app, I am greatly missing being able to tag my pages in the penultimate notebook in Evernote, making this a feature would make this a 5 star app. Being able to write notes on my iPad vs my disorganized notebook is going to help keep me much more organized!
8508      Thank you for this great app
9757      Decided to keep it simple. Test drive it, as it were. Couldn&#39;t find a simple way to move text between notebooks. No simple button like &#39;move to...&#39; Had to do the copy and paste route which is twitchy and not as simple as one would think. En route I ended up trashing the new note by accident-and now I can&#39;t find the trash to get it out. I was trying to copy the note to the new notebook, got it there. Went back to the old notebook and deleted the copy-didn&#39;t need it there anymore, right? It deleted it in the new notebook as well! Seriously? Without a warning like &#39;delete all copy is coming up dummy?&#39; 

Hmmmm...just spent 45 minutes trying to get this up and running smoothly. No go so far. Time to say goodby to this app and sister apps. Not worth the really horrid, over simplified &#39;tutorials&#39;, if that&#39;s what those are. 

Don&#39;t bother with this one.
6755      I use Evernote for work and home, including a shared notebook with my family. It&#39;s an indispensable part of my day to day life.  My one gripe is that starting to edit notes is difficult, it&#39;s like there&#39;s a huge delay when you tap to edit as if switching the app from viewing mode to editing mode is a huge deal.
9639      Evernote is the BEST! I am able to stay organized and manage my work tasks more efficiently.
6186      I love this app! It is playing a huge part in the organization of my dissertation research. I connect my desktop with all of my mobile devices using it. Thank you to the wonderful Evernote Geniuses for creating and maintaining this wonderful app!
6694      It helps to keep everything I do in order.
11627     After the today&#39;s update is ceasing every time
10720     I use Evernote to keep track of thoughts and ideas by leveraging the text and pictures.  I like the way the picture can be searchable.  I occasionally use the audio feature and would use it more if the whole audio note was searchable. The only gap is the ability to draw in a note and a way to keep ToDos.
6491      The best way to keep my notes organized. I love it!
4736      Love this app.
8566      I love this app. I am a freelance performer and artist and I use this app everyday
6319      I have looked around for different note taking apps for the iPad and I honestly can say that Evernote has never failed me. Love it and love the fact that I can keep my notes organized and access them anywhere!
5669      I don&#39;t know who approved this, but they should be fired! Talk about a step backwards and a leadership failure... The user interface is hard to read and is now just a cluttered mess... I had to stop using it... It took me twice as long to find my notes... I catch myself just jotting notes on a sticky pad and leaving them on my desk... This is ridiculous...
Shame, I&#39;ve been using evernote for years and here I am looking at alternatives...
3852      Suddenly freezes whenever it&#39;s opened. Deleting and reinstalling didn&#39;t fix. Now it won&#39;t even open. How could this app fail so completely?
6532      Simply THE BEST note taking app EVER! Very user friendly and so versatile. Just start using it and it will morph into the perfect place to put all of your ideas and memos.
5145      This update was the last straw for me. Evernote can&#39;t seem to get its UI priorities straight, and yet it has drastically changed them twice since I&#39;ve been a user. The last, card-based interface was bad enough, but this cramped, garish, moving one is vastly worse. I never had any idea where my stuff was, and that&#39;s half  the point of a mobile interface to Evernote. The other half is fast capture, and it still takes too many taps on too many little targets to get started.

Worst of all, even as a twice-paid user, this interface forces me to see ads and product updates instead of my stuff. Evernote was actually making me less productive now, and I was paying for the privilege. I&#39;ve had enough. Over the past two days, I moved all my notes into text files on my Mac and now use Dropbox for sync. I&#39;d rather make do with files and folders than hold on for another complete redesign of Evernote&#39;s interface.
9970      This totally keeps my life in order
7916      Love Evernote - organizes family of 5, two jobs, hobbies, master&#39;s degree and household paperwork!!
8349      This app is excellent. I have had it for years and was not that impressed in the past but recently revisited the app and now I can&#39;t live without it. It is easy to use and to send items to. It even stored voice recordings made on my phone. One of the best apps there is. Syncs on my ipad and galaxy III phone.
3562      Lets me keep organized. Lots of great addons.
4954      Can&#39;t use on the iPhone with new IOS 7. Sticks and will not open.  Fix it.  Please! And soon.
3624      My life is now in Evernote. Although there are occasional quirks it is now indispensable to me
8973      Password keeps telling me it&#39;s expired and emails me a reset email. When I click the reset email it says that email expired so basically I can&#39;t use Evernote. Time to delete.
6985      Nothing is better than evernote.
8691      Best note taking software I have seen.
10666     Very handy to collaborate my inspirations
12268     To do lists are simple and effective in Evernote.
5775      Sure it&#39;s in keeping with flat iOS7 design, but it&#39;s barely readable.  Whose idea was it to use light blue text on a light blueish green background and light green text on a white background?  Did anyone consider trying to read this outside in natural light?  Settings should allow the user to change the text or background color and the order of the main screen.  I don&#39;t want to see all Notes.  Having the Shortcuts is nice on top, but Notebooks in middle of the screen would be more useful instead of the all Notes feature.
9388      This app is the first app I got on my iPhone and is the only app I use almost daily. Truly remarkable capabilities and beyond easy to learn, use, an integrate into your life.
3636      So far everything I&#39;ve tried has worked. I like the &#34;Getting Started&#34; notes and videos as well as the knowledge base articles.
8116      If you have ever had an idea, read or seen something inspirational or needed to jot down a quick note then you need this app. I cannot count the number of times this app has helped me recall ideas, scenes and specific details that have been instrumental in a project (personal and professional). It is plainly a must have and keeps getting better through upgrades and partnerships. Just get it.
9037      Evernote has almost replaced my paper filing system.  No need to print anything anymore - everything is digitally filed and easily accessed on my phone, tablet and computer! I love it! I&#39;ve given it 4 stars because I&#39;m haven&#39;t been able to find a web clipper for my iPad and don&#39;t know why there isn&#39;t one available?
11186     Without peer the best writing application out.
5084      Evernote is an incredible tool and the app was perfect. Now it just doesn&#39;t work. Update the app so it doesn&#39;t crash please.
6583      Evernote has quickly become a mainstay for on the spot ideas. May replace my moleskin completely!
10896     Best app ever
4414      Update: I have decided not to renew my Premium subscription because Evernote&#39;s new ugly UI is too difficult to read and no one from the company is responding to the myriad of complaints.  It&#39;s time to move on.

For Pete&#39;s sake, even their website is unreadable with yellow font on a white background in areas and most areas have light gray on white or white font on light gray.  Who makes those decisions???

Extremely ugly UI! I know the logo is green but now they went and made the entire interface green green green. Difficult to read.  Change it back.
8613      Great ap.  Has become my best secretary....  never forgets anything.
9073      OK, so I was an information pack rat. Scrap paper hoarder. Where a twelve-step program failed, Evernote has saved me. I literally feel a weight removed, a new agility in life. I&#39;m not joking. See an ad for a restaurant you might want to visit some day 18 months from now? You gonna clip that ad and shove it in a shoe box? He&#39;ll no! Evernote it! If you want to remember it, if you need to remember it, Evernote it!
7676      It&#39;s all i need to remember.
5117      I want my old version that made notes easy. This version looks like someone hacked in and applied their dopey idiosyncratic skin just to make it hard for everyone.  BTW the function to search all notes is broken and only seems to search titles. The PC update was also a step back. Fire whoever led this redesign and get back on track.  This is a notes app not ecommerce or social networking.
9675      It would be more great if it was compatible to a lot more websites.

Other than that no real complaints.

Great for knowledge hoarder like me!
6046      This is best. Thanks.
7847      It took me years of listening to stories on Evernote before really getting into it. But now that I have, I&#39;m left wondering why I didn&#39;t start earlier! 

Super easy to organize and jot notes for everyday things.
10811     Best app ever !
6742      This is the app that I use the most and keeps me organized!

I would be lost without it.
11836     this new update won&#39;t let me open the app anymore ???? please fix it! I use this app for everything and I really need it
7017      It&#39;s awesome. Waaaaaay better than &#34;notes&#34; app that comes standard on iPhone. Love the multiple notebooks, the ease of adding pics or audio...

Only gripe is it should be easier to add a notebook from iPhone.
5675      Just for everyone to know if you install Evernote and your notes do not show up first you need to delete Evernote and reinstall and it will begin to sync again
8888      Love this app!! You can&#39;t ask for anything more in an app to get your life organized and help you to remember things. Everything is contained in one place. And what you can do with the information in a note is amazing. thanks so much. &#34;A&#34;.
11641     fix the bug!  What&#39;s the delay?
7403      For the ultra organized of the world, Evernote is a welcome addition to the arsenal in the war against paper files and forgetfulness. I am not that kind of person. When I feel like getting things super organized, I generally just wait for the feeling to pass.

Still, even for those who aren&#39;t organizing enthusiasts, Evernote can come in handy for snapping, saving, and then finding random items that appear on the screen.

For example, I keep forgetting how to do a screen capture on my iPhone. So I brought up the instruction page for that and captured it in Evernote. Now I can locate this page quickly and easily, whenever I need it.

This is light duty in comparison to how real enthusiasts use Evernote. Still, I&#39;m finding Evernote useful enough to be worth the space on both my PC and my iPhone.

Pros:
Extends your organizational reach to a smartphone
Synchronizes to your desktop and Mac Evernote
GPS-tags your notes and photos

Cons:
Premium pricing is $5/month or $45/year.!
7598      I have had text completely reformatted on updates.  I haven&#39;t used the app in awhile because of the problems.  I&#39;m getting back into it, but still can&#39;t adjust the font size.  You&#39;d think they&#39;d fix it by now. The font is tiny.  You can&#39;t make it bigger, or change the style.  My regular goto note taking program is now &#34;Day One&#34;.   If Evernote at least incorporates font settings and fixes formatting issues, I will use it more, but for now it&#39;s a troubled program, and better options are out there where the developers at least know the bare basics of what users want.  I&#39;d like to see a true Evernote competitor with fonts.  In my opinion that will be enough for people to ditch this program.  It would be like the migration from MySpace to Facebook.   I&#39;m waiting and searching.
11670     After download the updated version I can&#39;t open it anymore due to its constantly crashes. Please fix it ASAP. There are too much information on this app. Thanks God I have the PC version installed and synced.
10155     App keeps getting stronger every day.  Thanks Evernote!
10189     Everything a good app should be.
4767      This app helps me be more productive at work and at home. Love how every thought and note can be filed and easily found. The company does a good job with tips and ideas. The only opportunity is to improve their had written app. I use good notes and its the best, wish I could use evernote&#39;s app and store thugs easier.
6838      Keeps me organized. Make notes on my phone and they&#39;re on my computer when I get home. Keeps all your info connected, usable and easily retrievable.
8578      No way to delete a note using a smart phone. Tech support suggests using &#34;right click&#34; but that is not an option on a phone.

Sent from my iPhone
8501      So easy and integrated into outlook on the computer.
10433     Organized and well developed.
7514      it&#39;s good
3585      I use Evernote for my personal and work notes.  I purchased the premium account and have found it to be one of the apps that I use everyday.  

Thank you and keep up the great work.
10474     I use this app for many things. I trust it to keep my notes and documents in a safe place!
6029      The last UI wasn&#39;t bad. This one is horrible looking and hard on your eyes.
3567      Life would not be the same without my Evernote.
5500      I use Evernote for recording meetings all the time. It takes too long to start voice recording in this version
8301      A lot better than some apps I paid money for. A must have for iPad. Excellent job at creating a very functional and solid note app!
11887     App wouldn&#39;t open after updating on my iPhone. Had to delete and redownload to get it working
5355      Lost 8 of 10 notes with last update.  Not reliable.
11309     Was fine. After update, hangs on install. Had to delete. :-(
4582      Life is complicated. So much to remember. Evernote is indispensable to keeping up with everything.  I use Evernote on my laptop, iPhone, and iPad. It&#39;s the one app that I would not give up. 

Update: 10-7-12 Still the app I use the most. Gets better &amp; better. Can&#39;t imagine how I&#39;d get on without it.

Update: 5-12-13  Still the best! The app I use the most. Just keeps getting better.

Update: I&#39;m not wild about all the interface changes, but the usability keeps improving. Have not upgraded to iOS 7 yet.
8790      Once you start hiving every piece of info into Evernote, you can search and find anything you need very quickly.
10676     Terrific
5110      Very useful for corralling notes an thoughts. Use w/ web clipper on computer for even more versatility.
11403     Used to be a great app and I can still use it on my PC, but every time I open it it crashes. Literally every time. Useless on my iPhone and iPad.
4337      Trying to use it. Want to like it. Works on desktop, but just won&#39;t launch on my iPhone 5. Crazy.
4687      I&#39;ve run my life out of Evernote for 2 years now. It&#39;s my most vital app.
6860      Great for those with many projects
10297     Awesome note taking/organizing app. Great potential and lots to learn. So far, I&#39;m loving it.
6820      I really like Evernote, but with this new update the app instantly crashes after it opens. The app has literally gone from very helpful to completely useless overnight. I&#39;ll hold out hope for a quick patch, but for others I absolutely would not install this update unless you are ok with the possibility that the app completely stops working.
11480     Totally drop the ball by exposing its user base&#39;s login info. What&#39;s the point in using Evernote when it obviously cuts back on security for more profit.
11553     Been crashing on occasion since last update and now they update it to fix it but guess what? It crashes on startup now! Completely useless! Get it together please!
6929      Good
4878      Over the few years that I&#39;ve relied in Evernote, I have gone hot and cold several times with each update, but I think this is the best one yet. It replaces many of the add-on third party apps that made it work, and the shortcuts transferring from desktop to mobile have really been a game changer. Sometimes I feel like the app is a bit bloated and slow, but I don&#39;t have the newest phone, and seriously, how awesome does something have to be before you feel obligated to whine!? It crashed a bunch the first week, but it&#39;s more stable now, and despite the fact that Evernote doesn&#39;t perfectly cater to all of my expectations in all situations, I feel good about my investment in the franchise.
10091     Once I got familiar with the app I love it. I&#39;m using it in many ways. Great as a notebook. I just hope I can keep my info for a long time otherwise I&#39;ll be lost.
10326     I get an amazing amount of work done on my iPhone this app. By far the app I use most.
5342      The reviews for the new iOS7 are haunting so I opted out of the newest update. I copy &amp; paste a lot of quotes into Evernote but recently the paste option does not appear. &#39;Paste&#39; works in the search bar but not in my notes. I give this app 5 personal stars because I still have access to all the things I&#39;ve saved into Evernote and 3 actual stars for everything else.
8012      User interface a little clunky on the smartphone, in the info entry aspect

Will continue to improve, I&#39;m sure.

Syncs with EVERYTHING!!
3894      Update is COMPLETELY USELESS!  Freezes iPad every time!  Clean installs and reboots don&#39;t work!
4311      This app had worked nicely before, but the new version crashes every time... it might be too heavy for my old iPhone 4 :(
7601      I had trouble with notes on my notes app disappearing and was introduced to Evernote. Thank goodness! I live that I can search w/in a note.
6318      The second greatest thing since sliced bread! I use Evernote everyday , all day! For project management, and life management, can&#39;t be better!
4480      I&#39;ve been a premium Evernote user for quite a while, and have loads of content and important data in their system. This latest version renders it completely useless. It&#39;s literally been frozen at startup since the new iOS 7 version was released. 

They released an update which was to fix bugs and yet nothing has changed. As a paying customer I cannot continue to use tools that can&#39;t function with a high level of reliability.

Problems are understandable at times; but to not address them in a timely manner when you have paying customers is not.
9024      As a tentative adopter of cloud storage for all of the detritus of daily life, I find Evernote a convenient storage medium.  I&#39;d like to see more and easier to adopt template pages.
9923      Evernote is excellent.  Having it on  my iPad is super.  I am able to use it with all devices.  I recommend this.
10031     A few glitches but crosses platforms.
5721      I LOVE Evernote! However, after updating my iPhone 5 to iOS 7.0, Evernote does not work! It freezes every single time I open it and then shuts down. Please fix whatever is going on. I need my Evernote!
11467     Third &#34;upgrade&#34; in two days. Two of them including this one stop me getting into the app. Lousy work by the Evernote team.
12356     Is the new version of this app not compatible with &#34;iPad 1&#34;?!

When I open the app, it stays open for about ten to fifteen seconds, and then immediately closes.  No error message, warning, etc.  

Could someone clarify whether it just might not work with old iOS/iPad 1?  I hope this is not the case, because it is definitely my most used/useful app.  The semester is getting ready to start, and I need my Evernote!  Help!!!!
12090     Easy to use and fun way to organize lists etc.
4594      I like Evernote and I&#39;m confused to why all of these reviews are bad. I love how easy this app is and how it gives you multiple options for writing your note. It works great for school purposes and I highly recommend using this app for education or any other purpose. If I were to make a suggestion, it would be to add a simpler way to delete past notes, such as a swipe. Also, a way to be able to expand the screen while scrolled down to the bottom of your note, because it can be a pain to scroll all the way up and expand. Overall, it is a great app!
9782      I used to use my digital legal pad until I learned about this app.  It is awesome.  You can tag your notes so you can find them later and easily copy and paste things into the program or add pictures. Love it.
4475      Long time Evernote user. Sure, UIs are updated here and there but oh my god this is terrible. Updates are supposed to improve usability not make it worse. Also, I just lost more than half of my notes with this update. 

I&#39;m not ready to jump ship yet but I sure hope they are able to correct a lot of these issues...
11268     Cannot access any of my notes. Quite inconvenient.
5467      That&#39;s what this update is. It&#39;s as if Evernote decided to give a group of five year olds with crayons, full discretion over redesigning their app. Counter intuitive and horribly designed, you guys have managed to make a perfect 180 and ruin the best app for the ipad.
5835      Use Evernote a lot thanks.
12392     Works great with my Livescribe pen. 
You need Dropbox integration asap!
7532      If this app is as irreplaceable on my phone as it is on my laptop I will be thrilled I use it for everything all he time
4550      iOS 7.0.2 on iPhone 5

Currently unusable on my phone.
8700      Literally the best thing for me.. Syncs across all devices and keeps reminding me.. Totally perfect!
11313     You having security problem so all of your customers have to reset password. BRAVO.
10608     With only very minor exceptions Evernote works perfectly, as advertised.

The few problems I&#39;ve had have been immediately responded to (clear and understandable answers!) and corrected.

The flexibility it provides to capture and access information is amazing!

Highly recommended!
6696      It&#39;s pretty cool. Except one time I was writing with a combination of using regular sentences and paragraphs, and lists such as
1.
2. 
Or 
-
When I tried to jump back and forth, like normal... The app erased everything that was in the list... The entire lower half VANISHED... I&#39;ve since have been using google docs and apple notes... This app is dangerous especially if what your&#39;re jotting down is for work, like I was.
12372     Ever since the latest update, constant crashing on my iPad. Unusable
5672      Love this app. But it no longer works with the new redesign. Please give me my Evernote back.
5269      My dear friends, how could you?  Requiring iOS 7?  Really?  Please update your app to support iOS 6 as well. Thank you!
10210     Buy it!!!
7319      The app is a great way to take notes and keep multiple computers/phones updated in real time. It&#39;s not perfect but, so far, it&#39;s the best note taking app I&#39;ve come across. Keep up the good work!!!
8211      ?????????? ?? ? ??
8876      Excellent!
7469      Even more user friendly. Excellent update.
5577      Update: fixed.  Great app, great system.

It&#39;s a fantastic system but this update is not syncing notes! Please fix or revert to an old version ASAP!
6343      I recommend you download the desktop app &amp; web clipper &amp; just dive in. It seems challenging at first to preconceive all the right categories and tags, but you can honestly just get to writing &amp; organize as you go. Google the tips, read the blogs, &amp; just go! You won&#39;t be sorry.
11762     Ever since last update the app will not open &amp; I cannot access any of my notes!
iPhone 4S    iOS 6.1.2
5921      For the organized challenged like myself - finally something that is simple, easy to access, and fun to use, thank you for a great app!
9141      This app really helps me with sorting my notes. Works efficiently and allows me to keep organized. Love it!!
5328      I agree with all the other reviews that say this update is an absolute mess. Nothing works. The interface is awful and the app is virtually impossible to use. I tried to make a simple note on a picture yesterday and it turned into a complete exercise in futility. I&#39;m currently searching for a replacement to Evernote.
4102      Ever since the update I can&#39;t see the entire note. 1/3 of the screen is taken up by the list. Not liking it
12357     I use this app for so many things! The ability to share notes is one of my favorite aspects.
3881      You screwed me again.  Traveling and cannot access anything on iPad 2 with iOS 7--crashes instantly.  Where is your QA?  I am PAYING YOU for this service.
8715      Great App! Convenient, Simple, and Easy to Use.
It really helps me to keep track of things- including Documents- and I use it to Log, Journal, Plan and to Organize Thoughts. I also created a notebook in which I can store old entries for future reference.

Unfortunately, I can&#39;t view, add or change any of my notebooks on the website. I&#39;m also having trouble logging in to Evernote using the MacBook App, so I haven&#39;t been able to use it on my computer, which I would be nice to be able to do...  However, the iPhone App works very well!

Suggestions:
I would appreciate 1or 2 font color choices (there&#39;s the highlighter but an additional highlight or font color would be nice). I also think small pics should be the default rather than large pictures- that kind f threw me off at first when I emailed something to a friend. Also would be nice if people with whom you share a notebook can write comments or make changes in different color/highlight (but you can choose to keep the original or it gets stored as drafts)... All just small details and ideas... Altogether a really wonderful App! Thank you, Evernote!
7265      I use it every day. Love it.
9406      Great for personal, work, shopping, and reference/bookmarking interesting articles on the web!  Perfect tool to organize all of life&#39;s info.
8418      Love that it can be as simple as you want it to be.
6505      I use it for my job, it had made my tasks  a lot simpler, and a lot easier for me. It has been very helpful in the long run.
9878      This is an awesome note taking app!! Easy to use and access!!
6926      Great for notes and centralizing documents. I put business docs,quilting patterns, meeting agendas, and my gift list. I can access these items anywhere on any device. LOVE IT!
3869      Evernote was working fine on both my iPad and iPhone ...until the last upgrade.
I don&#39;t even get to the login .... It crashes.
Wasted Premium membership.
11161     DO NOT USE THIS APP YOUR DATA IS NOT SECURE! Lost all my data and no help to get it back
7605      The title says it all. But let me add . . . I couldn&#39;t exist without it. This App was made for the capabilities of the iPad.
7525      Awesome app for an awesome cloud note syncing service!
5165      I Love Evernote, but this new version is very unreliable. Sync isn&#39;t working. The new Design- eh? #premium version.
11110     It&#39;s really useful now it just needs a dragon dictate so I can quit copy and pasting lol useful app though =]
8615      As a pc&#39;er who uses Microsoft Office, including OneNote, after my husband bought me this iPad, I have been very impressed with how much better Evernote is in so many ways.  I&#39;m now in the process of moving most of what I have in OneNote over to Evernote-- especially now that I have the syncing between my pc and my iPad.
8467      Evernote keeps all of my documents at my fingertips regardless of where I am or what role I am undertaking. Whether it&#39;s teaching, writing, or even cooking. Evernote is there! Great app to be used with iPad, iPod, and my PC. Thanks!
12415     Started out good but has a severe bug.  When performing certain functions, the keyboard will disappear and not reappear, so you cant edit notes.  This happens when editing links.  Closing the app and reopening doesn&#39;t help.  This is a huge problem and ruins a would be great app.
7990      The combination of Evernote with Siri makes writing documentation very easy.
7325      I love this app! It is so easy to use. I can create notes fast and the options to format the text are easy and effective. I find myself using it, we&#39;ll, all the time.
4312      I&#39;m so surprised at all of the bad reviews. I have not had any major problems with this app. In fact, it&#39;s my go to app for just about everything.
11380     Worthless.  Deleted my login info.  now I have to go searching for it again.  They keep getting hacked search google for Evernote hacked.
5050      Can&#39;t think of a better app to keep my life straight.
3863      Just updated and cannot get past start screen. No access to information. Critical error.
7642      I love this ap. use it on the go but also to store travel info to easily access. Also like web integration.
11748     Doesn&#39;t work! I downloaded the new update and now the app crashes as soon as it opens. Please fix!!
4663      Handiest tool I&#39;ve found for organizing the mass of information from all kinds of sources that agents have to deal with on a daily basis. No more worries about where I put the gate access or lock box codes. What was the association fees in that community I showed in last year?  And notes and documents for any deal are all in one place, accessible from whatever device I have with me. 
Evernote. You are a life saver :)
7753      Evernote is an amazing tool for saving those quick notes you used to write on scraps of paper -- and promptly lose. I use it to take notes during meetings, for saving knitting patterns, tracking my favorite websites and related passwords and for all my brainstorming notes about my job and my writing. Easy to use and accessible from all my devices, I couldn&#39;t live without Evernote!
4359      Fix please
8209      Works as advertised. Love the link to penultimate!
5197      I&#39;ll give it some time before updating my review.
11983     This app is a top pick!  Very versatile with &#34;holding&#34; pictures, links, and larger notes. Syncing to computer was effortless. I use those notes to create documents for work. A work life integrator. I request a way to move a note to a different notebook, but maybe Im missing obvious steps. Great!
7669      Evernote is awesome. It has come in very handy. I think Evernote should make an agenda, that would be magnificent.
3571      I cannot calculate how much sanity Evernote has brought into my life, but it&#39;s a lot. Evernote has changed the way I organize, live, and learn for the better. Thank you, you stellar designers and developers!!
11843     iPhone 5. Was working. Now not.
4542      I love Evernote. BUT the iPad version is user un-friendly, non-intuitive, visually distracting and difficult to use. Evernote should get some help from Apple staff on how to create a satisfying user interface.

Evernote staff: please listen to all the reviews and fix this app.
4616      I used to like Evernote a lot. But recently things are getting out of control that I feel like a review must be written to reflect this. I tried to send feedback but received no response. 

1. Sync issue. There used to be a sync button and after clicking it you are almost 100% sure your changes are synced and it is. I can&#39;t find this button anymore and not sure if it&#39;s related but I found out of sync issue everywhere. I would have made changes on my phone and sit there for ten minutes and changes still not reflected on the web browser, vice versa. Please look into this serious issue!

2. Evernote used to support inserting photos anywhere in the document where the cursor is and now it always append to the end. I really don&#39;t understand why it is so user unfriendly. I hope it&#39;s just a bug but please fix it. 

3. When inserting photos, one can only insert one at a time. This is really annoying! 

4. Cannot insert other files such as PDF etc.
9827      I have two accounts: one for work and one for home. The work account is pc only, but I really like the ability to create notes that live on my hard drive not the cloud. Home: I organize recipes, create a home inventory, brainstorm blog posts, collect interesting articles...no limits! I have used it to plan vacations (all my tickets and confirmations are there at a touch-I even saved a coupon into Evernote and had the place accept the non-printed version). Sign up for their email to get ideas: this is THE indispensable app, and you need it on your laptop/desktop too. For posting from iPad and iPhone, get memclipit.
4140      I&#39;ve been an Evernote user since 2009 and recently upgraded to premium. I thought it improved my work/life productivity before but now my life is even more organized. The new reminders and document scanning features are awesome!
10149     I use Evernote on an iPad, and it has made taking notes in college much easier. Now I use it for everything. My only suggestions would be improved compatibility with PDF files and more advanced formatting tools.
4284      The amount of things you can do with Evernote are endless and having access to this one of a kind program on your iPhone makes my life so much more organized!

Side note: I personally love the new design. I think it is beautiful and functional.
4216      I am a longtime Evernote user. I depend on it for work and home. So it pains me to give a poor review, but the performance on my iphone 4 is so awful, it&#39;s essentially unusable. Every tap requires a several second long pause. Typing is impossible. You type, and hear the clicks, but nothing happens. Then 10 seconds later, all your characters come spilling out. It does this after every 3rd or 4th character. I wish I was exaggerating. Even though it is useless for adding or editing, it&#39;s still able to show old notes, so it gets 2 stars for that. Ugh.
12155     I get things done, I&#39;m organized, I don&#39;t waste time at work, it&#39;s changed my game plan. Still learning all the aspects of Evernote, it&#39;s just opened up a place where I love to work again because I accomplish so much more in less time! 
 5 star review is well deserved!
6697      Wish I knew about Evernote a long time ago! The best ever! I use it everyday to organize my notes including audio and pictures. I can even email them to my colleagues and supervisor!
7943      When I got my ipad, all I wanted for productivity was the &#34;voice memo&#34; app,  and the &#34;notes&#34; app...  Much to my surprise, the ipad does not have a native voice memo app... But Evernote has made said apps obsolete. Voice memos in the same note as the text, multiples of each tying to the same idea.  Easy to find... Easy to share... I haven&#39;t even begun to take advantage of the potential of this app... meta organization of all of my notes / categories / sub categories....  
In summary, Evernote is the end all for recording all the little things you&#39;d want to remember, and makes it easy to organize and find, in more ways than you&#39;d expect.  Get it now.
5994      Amazing note taking app and has everything I would if anything it&#39;s missing a small feature or two but the ONLY* problem I have right now is after updating to iOS 7 and updating the app, it said that it couldn&#39;t be downloaded yet it still opens with the new iOS 7 look. No issue there but the problem is that it keeps crashing!! I seriously need this for school and this crash is not helping at all!!
9602      I&#39;ve been using Evernote for 4 years and it just keeps getting better. Everything is easy to search and it has always worked flawlessly.
11781     Updated to the latest version, will not open, crashes every time. please fix it!
4553      A very good product overall- however I wish I understood some features better.  The basics are good and easy to learn.
8083      Great way to stay organized
3641      I love Evernote
9168      Great app very handy, can&#39;t stop using it !!!!!
11136     Gets better the more u use it
10584     Can&#39;t say that about much else I use. My only complaints are that it takes a few seconds to load on the iPhone,  and if I type too fast on iPad it lags. But regardless it&#39;s my most useful app, by far.
4845      Amazing (i do love the new update. Haters are insane)
8713      I have been using Evernote for just a short time.  It is very easy to use.  I will be using it in the classroom to present content.  I will also be using it as a daily organizing tool for myself.
4266      Give these guys some credit. They completely resigned the app for iOS 7. There will be bugs. I have had a few but I know that they have a good vision. 

Evernote for life!
8237      This best of all note organizing apps has &#34;improved&#34; itself into an increasingly annoying user experience. 
For example, when I open the app on my iPhone - Hmm, where is search? Nowhere to be seen, that&#39;s where. Are they kidding? What&#39;s the first thing you want/need to do when opening a data base if all the notes in your life? Hint, maybe look got the one you want? It&#39;s kinda like the elephant in the room, you know?

I could go on, but this added &#34;Feature&#34; would be hard to top, if top is the word.
4306      What were they thinking?? New update cumbersome, difficult. Cannot open to a simple logical view of all notebooks as before. Have to go through process of opening a tab now. No idea how to quickly, intuitively create a new note book. No way to update the favorites list from the favorites list itself.
6033      5 stars for synching. Best note taking app out there. 

Broken in iOS 7 though. 0 notes displayed.
8750      This is my favorite app for managing my notes, meeting minutes, financial files, etc.  One suggestion would be to have the date and time automatically populate a field in new notes.  Other than that I think it is great!
10761     I use Evernote to write my notes as a flight instructor on my iPad and it keeps everything neatly stored and organized! I recommend this app to anyone!
6435      Very useful and easy to get used to. Has a lot of features.
10394     Love the dictation feature!
11680     This is ridic
7594      I use Evernote constantly to quickly store info that is then searchable and available on all my devices. A lifesaver!!!
11570     These guys really don&#39;t seem to test their releases before sending them out.  This is not the first time that it took several releases to get it right.  When they DO get it right, this is a 5 start app. But now it crashes if you select &#34;Created&#34; or &#34;Title&#34; for the viewing mode.  Save yourself some headache and NEVER update Evernote until the reviews indicate that they got the bugs fixed.  And that would NOT be version 5.2.1.
3667      Great app. Love the redesign. Please do take out the marketplace and announcement ads though. Thanks.
6585      I&#39;ve been using Evernote for a few months now.  It certainly is a useful app.  I probably haven&#39;t used it to its full potential.
10937     I&#39;ve used it for years and find it indispensable. I wish the formatting were easier to use in the mobile app. I bullet point a lot, which works fine on my Samsung tablet and the desktop version. I can&#39;t recommend this app more highly.
7968      This is one of my most used apps &amp; favorite apps. I use it all day - everyday. There are special features on each device: iPhone - iPad - Mac, that make them all unique and indispensable.
11321     Note: I am using 4th gen iPad 
I thought using Evernote on my iPad would be a more efficient way to take quick notes than using my MacBook and the desktop application. This proved to be wrong because of Evernote for iPads performance issues. It&#39;s glitchy to scroll up and down a note and when typing. The screen stutters with any finger movement. It&#39;s frustrating to switch from the perfectly smooth chrome browser and paste text into Evernote and find a very poor experience.
3581      Use it all the time, so useful!
