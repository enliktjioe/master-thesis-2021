482       This is the best game of all time
77        Really fun and awesome
1503      I got the update and it turns off when it lods
670       This update is plain bad. It&#39;s one thing to make the levels challenging but to make them near impossible with no real reward, well, that misses the point entirely. I didn&#39;t finish Bad Piggies and won&#39;t be finishing this either.
1410      I love the angry birds collection and have them all, except for angry piggies which I will buy later
1415      It said there is a new pink bird in the birthday level but I have not seen it
1090      Needs a restore purchase button. Bought the eagle awhile ago and now can&#39;t get it back.
1508      Awesome game!  Addicting and fun. Where&#39;s the last level?  Still five stars!!!  Well worth the price.
971       Fun
1199      looks bad on iphone 5 its stretched
1089      I wasn&#39;t even able to load the first level before crashing. Brilliant.
577       I have to agree with many other reviewers. The new levels are awful, and completely away from the traditional &#34;Angry Birds&#34; gameplay. It&#39;s more of a frustration, than enjoyment. You will end up with panic disorder, racing to get the egg away from the bad piggies, in their impossible to destroy contraptions and an impossible to control bird!!!

I get that they want to &#34;spice&#34; up the game a bit. But, that is what they made the other Angry Birds Games for! What they should have done, was create a whole different game for these new kinds of gameplay. 

Hopefully, it is beyond clear to them, that not too many people enjoy these new levels. The regular gameplay was just fine. The traditional gameplay is one of the things that make this game great. Why try to change it, if it didn&#39;t need to be changed to begin with? 

Well Rovio, hopefully you have the same person who came up with these awful new levels, reading our fabulously accurate reviews, so they get the hint that it stinks??!! 
Furthermore, we do hope you take our reviews seriously, and do your absolute best not to flub up any more levels on a game that was great just the way it was!!  ??????
?????????????
It WAS Great fun!!! AND, it WAS Fun for ALL ages too!!
966       I love this awesome game! The Mighty Eagle? Awesome! So for a great game, I give you 5 stars. I love the entire Angry Birds series! Keep it up!
1489      Please fix issue for iPhone - every time I&#39;m playing the game and a phone alarm, incoming call, text, etc pops up (which I hit the snooze or ok button) the sound then goes off the game and the only way to fix it is to reboot phone). Please help!
1433      Had for over a year and still play it.
381       Chuck speeds
755       I love Angry Birds, but hate the new feathers levels. Definitely a step in the wrong direction, enough to make me write my first review ever in hopes that you do not continue with this version of AB. Lets just pretend this never happened and go back to our old ways, ok?  Ok.
31        This is Gerch&#39;s favorite app.  Gerch loves to see how many reindeer dragons she can fit in her park to match her favorite reindeer sweater - Love Gerch *o*
50        Constant pop ups trying to sell &#34;super birds&#34; that don&#39;t really do much take away the pleasure of the game.  It is quite annoying.  I think the time has come to delete my old pals A Birds.  Sad.
241       Awsome
345       You want to go back to find more points.
355       I love this game a lot!
125       I love this update but change how pigs look in the other episodes
384       So my 5 year old plays this game and when we were at the fair he was beating pigs. And pretends like all eggs are his bloody precious and try&#39;s to strangle my wife when she makes scrambled eggs.
1390      Great game worth the dollar
71        Since the last update this game crashes constantly and is unplayable. iPhone4S
1059      I love Angry Birds. However, the reset time after the last effort is very irritating. Having to wait until the last bird poofs away gets tiresome.
840       What a waste of time. The tapping and aiming is so frustrating. I&#39;ve gotten three stars on three levels and played all day. Very disappointed in these levels. I wish I could have given it no stars for the review. I guess I&#39;m back to waiting for new normal levels. Thanks for raising my hopes and then crushing it with this crap
819       I have all the angry birds games and love new levels.   This most recent update is awful.  It pretends to be angry birds but it isn&#39;t.   I find it frustrating to play and not fun at all. I am hoping Rovio gets the message and sticks to adding regular levels in the future.
995       My phone crashed and when I reinstalled everything, I no longer had the Mighty Eagle which I had already purchased.  I want my eagle back!!!!
1319      Very very good
325       This game is really cool. I like it and I think people will enjoy it. Make sure you check out the other Angry Birds games. 
(The reason my nickname is Scribblenaustin is because I really want Scribblenauts Unlimited for Christmas)
983       More levels?
589       This game is really addicting i play ot like every day, i think though this game gets way more attention than needed!
1308      ???? ????
494       Wonderful game! Can other birds have mighty feathers?
675       I confirmed to update this game 5 days ago.   Has just barely started installation. Wth
673       So,how can you come out with a game where the good guys are so weak and slow compared to the bad???
1529      This game is amazing!!!! I am on 16-8!!! I use this game to pass time!
491       Ruined my favorite game.  New one isnt fun at all.
1091      Fun to spend time
963       Addictive! Great graphics and the physics engine is dead-on!
1064      Good game and make bad piggies free please
1528      This game is perfect for all you boring people out there......... It&#39;s the same on every level. Why are pigs stealing eggs??? Why are they green??? Why do birds even need a slingshot, can&#39;t they just fly anyway??? So many questions... Stupid, repetitive, boring game. Don&#39;t buy. Save your money for gameloft.
665       I love angry birds but this new level is really unpleasant and confusing.
262       Some have complaints but I think it&#39;s pretty addicting! Once the bugs were fixed it runs great and I never have a dull moment waiting in line, when I&#39;m on break at work, or riding in the car.
60        Latest version totally shuts down my music when opening this to play. Fix this!
310       I like it but all the updates make it hard to beat
821       Still mono...
340       I love all of the games. So does my 4 yr old son. He&#39;s better than a lot of adults are. I play on my 3rd gen iPod touch. I just wish this thing could go past iOS 5. I&#39;m always looking forward to updates tht include new levels. Keep it up Rovio!!! You guys are the kings of the gaming world!!!
260       Still good game and I also like the cartoons. My kids love them.
307       Awesome Game
602       It is basically a completely different game. One that is more frustrating and annoying. I really don&#39;t like the time pressure!!!
304       Great iPhone game.
1042      I love this game, it&#39;s so irresistible I can&#39;t put it down!!!
615       The &#34;Red&#39;s Mighty Feather&#34; update has completely turned me off to Angry Birds.  The mechanics are completely different, the strategy/problem-solving aspect is totally gone, and if your shot is so much as a pixel off from what the developers apparently intended, you essentially fail and have to restart the level.

The &#34;Red&#39;s Mighty Feathers&#34; levels are frustrating, poorly designed, and just not fun.
52        It is a fine game intill all of the ads comes and blocks the screen, and the new powerups are not smart. I bought this game to injoy a game the old fashion way, not cheep my way out of the levels
317       Says to update, but won&#39;t! Updated 10 other apps in one minute, but this one won&#39;t even begin updating after 5 minutes.
1132      love the game. So much fun. But it is not fair that in Ham &#39;Em High , we have to log onto facebook and like you, because we paid for the app, so we should get the levels, and some of us don&#39;t have a facebook account, i paid for the app, I should get the levels. I would like you guys on facebook but i can&#39;t because i dont have a facebook account. I brought the mighty eagle on my ipod but it didn&#39;t transfer to the app on my iPhone. So buy once unlimited use is a lie.
1226      Players who want to play would have bought it earlier.
1477      Birdies are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
545       I really like the new levels. I think it would be cool if you added a level creator where you could make levels and share them with friends.
24        Time just flies when your having fun.
719       Bird does NOT go where I tap the screen in the new levels. It seems to either lock onto a pig, or shoot horizontally no matter where I hit the screen. Not playing again without an update
549       not the one i know and love
1530      Why do I have to wait so long to get past the ad for [whatever the ad is for-I refuse to pay attention to it since I paid for the app]. I might as well play a game that doesn&#39;t penalize me for playing.
661       The new update has a huge bug that causes some of the missions to have the targeting locked on a certain point no matter where you press. This is game breaking.
745       Are the best yet....love the new gameplay and goals...totally awesome. Can&#39;t wait for more levels and hopefully a boss level with King Piggy
944       Add icould support to the game so your purchases and records can be save so when ever you want to delete and download the game again thank you
169       Best game app ever! Second to none!
527       Seems the new ones only take speed. Accuracy is more challenging to me.
803       Sorry Rovio-------this new level just doesn&#39;t do it for me. Not to mention, you took the original music away! ??

Really wish there was an option to keep the original tune or not!
968       I waited 2 hours in order to get this app. What a rip off!!
416       BEST APP UPDATE EVA!!!!!!! Lol
238       This is the best game!!!
919       The new version is not good. While I like the gist of the concept, the levels get harder with the moving target and set you up at an unfair advantage. You also don&#39;t get any additional tools to gel fight the pigs and you find yourself quickly going over your quota of shots by level 6. Not worth the update.
856       Not enjoying the new update. 
+1 for trying a new idea but its not fun
426       I thought I paid .99 to remove ads but apparently they&#39;re back. This is completely unfair Rovio.
1537      ??Some people are so annoying they are like is boring, is this a scam?, etc. I love this game?? and why would you want the same game on more then one of your iPod, iPad, iPhone??
100       Love the new level! Can&#39;t stay off it! Keep up the good work.
472       I love it
835       I am having a blast with this new update! Thank you! I am a big fan!
421       If they were going for the &#34;New Coke&#34; effect it worked. It is back to real angry birds and is better then ever.
68        Please bring back the trajectory line or at least make it to where you can turn it on or off. That&#39;s one of the thing I loved about the game before and why it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve played it. I have all of then except Rio. I love the fact the both Star Wars has then but not sure why you got rid of them on the original and seasons.
1111      Go download bamboo wallet and use the code AC1789176. Thx (???)
248       This is my favorite game
136       Dear Angry Bird team, me and and a group of people had been discussing the matter of writing to you about an idea of the same Angry Birds concept but in the Marvel super hero perception, the same as Angry Birds Star Wars but Marvel. Please take our concern. 
Thank you for reading.
680       I like angry birds cause it&#39;s cool
655       Angry Birds used be a fun and addicting game, and now the latest update has absolutely RUINED the game! &#34;Red&#39;s Mighty Feathers&#34; is WAY too difficult! I appreciate a good challenge, but this is just ridiculous! The newest levels are literally IMPOSIBLE to complete and are flat out frustrating! Do NOT download this game because Rovio has ruined the game that we&#39;ve come to love, and if you have the game, don&#39;t update it! Rovio needs to fix the game and get rid of the new levels, or else they&#39;re going to lose a lot of fans and the franchise is going to fail! Not even worth one star.
1413      Thank you for making this game so so cool LOL!!!!!!WOW!!!!!!!!
1336      Better beans
1041      Not compatible
124       It was great!!! Then it was updated and I was super excited!! The levels looked awesome!! But I can&#39;t play them, not any levels, even the ones I already beat.
1488      I have not encountered any problems so far with this app.
515       Angry birds went from 5 stars to 1 star. This new level is really disappointing it is not fun, I missed the original game I&#39;m playing it just to get over with it. I felt like I lost my interest in Angry Birds. Too bad.
428       Glad the designers listened to the fans.
905       It&#39;s not working for my iPod fourth gen. It doesn&#39;t even let me get to the actual gameplay
351       Fun
742       Why change a good thing?
1353      I can&#39;t get passed the first level because it crashes
998       Keep it up Rovio!
985       Another update!  Glad that the developers keep up on the apps. 

The update is great and the retina display is a welcomed addition. 

The game is number 1 for a reason. The fans made it #1, not Apple.
240       Suwu game #1
1533      This games is a family favorite.
366       Simply addicting! Thanks to bug fix, much much better!!!! 6/5 stars!!!
1182      I love playing this on my iPhone
530       I updated this app. When I opened this app, it erased all my data. I will never play this app again
372       I used to enjoy it but now with Bad piggies and next it is more and more difficult to get 3 stars, it is not fun anylonger; stay away from it, specially the red&#39; feather crap, not the classic episode, it is garbage
1506      Very good.
1329      Where&#39;s my $0.99???
30        Really love this game. Play it every day.

395       Awesome and very addictive
66        I don&#39;t know about this update, but it might be good.
362       Best app game ever
809       The new Angry Birds episode (Red&#39;s Mighty Feathers) is a piece of JUNK.  It is not worth an update. If this is the kind of garbage we have to look forward to then I am done with Angry Birds.
902       Could be the worst thing I have seen. Great stuff usually from Angry Birds. This however does not make any sense. Hell the screen does not even move on the 1st level. 

You have my money already but if other franchises come out, I will pass if this the direction you are going. Good work though if the purpose was to be completely different from other levels and giving the user no clue what the objective is.
1156      I suggest that the next angry bird be angry birds &#34;lord of the rings.&#34;love this game,can&#39;t stop thinking about it!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????
950       Even after buying the &#39;full&#39; version you still get ads for other angry birds games.  And even after paying real life money to unlock the eagle, you can only use it every so often.  This is a wonderful example of what is wrong with apps for iPhone in general.  I got duped into giving them some money, hopefully someone in the future will be dissuaded by this.  Rovio is an awful money grabbing company and knowing what I know now I will never give them another cent.  I encourage all to follow suit.
142       I thought I loved &#39;Angry Birds&#39; before the update, but the mad scientist lab is incredible. Takes me back to playing the game for the first time and it was just plain ole&#39; fun. You guys have totally outdone yourselves with the adorable scenery and characters. More please... (PS- no offense but I was getting bored with the SW series)
583       I&#39;m always looking forward to Angry Birds updates but this last one is awful. Red feathers flying around telling you what to hit-it doesn&#39;t even feel like Angry Birds anymore. Please go back to levels like in the beginning. You are ruining this super fun game!
964       This is awsome
999       The games pretty good. But now every time I go to this app it automatically goes home, so now I can&#39;t even play. It was fun but now it&#39;s just taking up space.
1266      Fun
276       Absolutame divertido. 100%
480       I like the new update rovio keep up the good work
942       If I had a duck I would name it Lewis ??
1302      It&#39;s not that fun I mean its fun when you play it for a little while but then you get so bored of it and I payed 99cents for it and now it&#39;s free what I want my money back!!!!!!
1363      I&#39;ve been waiting four years for it to be free and today is the day! Now I can know what all the fuss is about!
1277      Had this years ago when I payed for it (shut up its only a dollar you payed for) I wanted to see what the hype was... It&#39;s appeal lasted for the first chapter then it became an mucus emcee
1049      But since I downloaded it I&#39;ve been having sound issues with my phone
938       Ok got to the bonus surf and truf, now what??
1235      Very good game but old
45        This is the #1 game of all time with hours and hours of bird slinging action, you would be wasting money on your iPhone if you didn&#39;t get it.
1282      Why!
271       This is one of the best games ever!
1374      You seriously rating this game lower over the picture? Who cares, thanks for a great free game.
1480      Stringbeam1, it&#39;s the original one, so obviously it isn&#39;t themed -.-
116       I pooped my pants
723       Great game. I love that the update lets you have one more page of fun!
1014      REALLY fun but some levels are near to impossible
1031      This app, angry birds rio, angry birds seasons, and angry birds space keep crashing. I&#39;m expecting updates soon.  I love the games.
533       Bring it back---
436       Here&#39;s my review for Red&#39;s Mighty (Crappy) Feathers: it&#39;s just not fun. I lost interest quickly. I hope Rovio sees all these 1 star reviews and takes them to heart. Rovio, please go back to what you&#39;re good at!
616       So addictive
1275      Hey I think this game is cool but its kinda stupid cuz all you do in it is fling a bunch of little birds around. :) thts ok tho... I STILL LUVVVVV ITTTT!!!!!
79        It has been cutting out and restarting in the middle of my games, so that I am unable to beat high scores or get more stars. Not cool. And it restarts the game so when I try to get back to the game, it hasn&#39;t paused in the level and I have to go through the first screen again.
1168      Fun when it first came out but it first came out
1418      Teaches while having fun.
1354      Game crashes every time in the new update :/
1086      Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
487       Since I got the mighty eagle I am forced to sign in each time I play, truly annoying.
1048      ??????????
16        Fun really like the new levels
586       People are complaining about the new update of Angry Birds. It&#39;s just an ADDITION of levels to the original game with a twist, and it&#39;s NOT that bad. Sure, it&#39;s different from the previous levels, but it&#39;s unique and could get a bit challenging if you play the whole thing instead of just playing two levels and saying it&#39;s horrible. I&#39;m sure there will be more levels of the same classic Angry Birds coming soon, so all the complainers need to take a seat and be patient. Great job on the game, Rovio! And for all who don&#39;t have the game, don&#39;t let these reviews prevent you from getting it. You don&#39;t have an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch unless Angry Birds is on it.

P.S. I don&#39;t work for Rovio or anything, F.Y.I.
382       The game is fun and all but the the pop ups are awful and it notes me about cartoons! Sorry but the game is just not fun anymore.And u pay for the toons by the way.
176       One of my favorites.
1000      Angry Birds rock! But the Toons are so great there should be a different app for it. I would honestly be willing to pay for an Angry Birds Toons app for one or two dollars set up exactly how it is set up on the Angry Birds app or a little different as long as it&#39;s not confusing. I love Red and Chuck. More Angry Bird Toon videos with them please. 5 stars easy!! GET THIS GAME!!! Mighty eagle rocks too.(:
782       the new song awful,terrible,horrible,etc.
747       Big complaints about it. 1) bird doesn&#39;t seem to go where I click, but rather in the general direction of the pig...extremely annoying. 2) the extremely slow speed that the birds reload. 3) at the beginning of level the extremely slow speed that I&#39;m given control (I&#39;m swiping to get to the bird, but no response). If the first two are fixed, then I&#39;d give it 4 stars.
1332      I don&#39;t see what all the hype is about. Really kind of dumb. Throw birds at buildings to kill pigs.. Nintendo has better games for casual gamers. If you want a really great game on the App Store check out infinity blade, Tiny, Tower, Warzone: Anomaly, Eufloria, or anything by Telltale Games. Kairosoft makes pretty fun and cute games, too.
1025      I used to love this app but when ever I try to do anything it crashes and won&#39;t let me open it again
1372      Really I don&#39;t know how this got millions of downloads I got it while it was free and I still feel ripped off.
644       Every time I try to play the new episode it always crashes but never the other episodes
204       The constant interruptions and harassment&#39;s to buy something took the fun out of the game. Recently the game would auto send me to other websites. I paid for these games, this wasn&#39;t suppose to happen....Grrr
463       Cool
375       Once, I wrote a good review for this app. I am now realizing how dumb I was. This app is like giving a dead body plastic surgery before its burial, with the surgery prolonging the burial. I can not wait until the Angry Birds fad ends. It has been around for 3+ years and all they ever add is 15 levels every three months or so to milk the franchise. END IT PLEASE! To conclude... I wish to bash all of the five-star reviewers over their heads with various pottery.
1054      Look in the settings for Magic Places. Can&#39;t believe I just noticed it. They will track you even if the app is closed.
1202      But if it&#39;s gonna stay free I would like a refund pppppplllllllllllllllleeeeeeeeaaaaaaaassssssssssseeeeeeeeeee?!?!?!?!?!?!????????????????????$ back 
$ back $ back $ back $ back
818       New levels are horrible...totally different game than angry birds in my opinion. Developers dropped the ball on this update.
922       Awesome with moving targets
1044      Wish this and Seasons had the dotted lines like Space and Star Wars.
185       This is a game i will be playing when i&#39;m old because it really is an all time classic! :) POWER TO THE BIRDS!
514       imagine a new game of angry birds when the pigs go zombies or in the after life heaven (angry birds) vs hell (pigs)
671       Whenever I click a level on my iPod touch, it crashes automatically. I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s doing it.
57        Used to be cool but now if I try to three star a level those stupid &#34;buy me&#34; pop-up birds come up and it&#39;s annoying.
1005      This is a must have game for your iPhone, iPod, or smartphone. ??
1162      Good things come to people who wait, and the good thing is, THIS APP IS FINALLLY FREEEE!
1485      You should get it. It&#39;s much better than the free version. It&#39;s easy and challenging at the same time. It&#39;s a game anyone can play.
44        The game is awesome and challenging... I like it!
1108      It keeps on crashing on me I hate fix it now
890       Well this annoying million dollar mobile game does not provide challenging mind games but people buy this game all the time sigh.......
737       The newest update is terrible. It&#39;s too hard and too repetitive. Please do something to make it more interesting, or stop designing these ridiculous new levels.
974       Still a good game but old version was better
102       Please put an indigo bird into the game.  It doesn&#39;t matter what power you give it.  Just please - can you put an indigo bird? I really want an indigo bird!!!  Please!!!

Please!!! { :):):):):):):):):):):) if you put an indigo bird :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:( if you don&#39;t put an indigo bird. } It doesn&#39;t even matter what you name it.  I won&#39;t be upset with the look either.   It could be a magpie, you know. Please put an indigo bird!!!! Just please!!!! Thanks for reading! And please put an indigo bird!
414       It kills a lot of time and keeps you busy for hours!!!!
584       I think angry birds is a waste of money and is getting old. Instead of wasting money on new levels just get a new game. But since this is only an opinion i would truly suggest with whatever you feel like since it is your $0.99
108       It just make angry bird more fun with the electric shock I can&#39;t wait for a new episode of the game
893       Its good
1074      Great game but, how many times do I have to purchase the ?mighty eagle?!? Every time there&#39;s a mega update, I have to purchase the eagle again! Rip offs.
221       I ?????????? this game I Whod have gave this game 100 stars
1471      Good &amp; nice
814       Can&#39;t play the new updated version because it keeps crashing. Add new levels, not games within the game.
722       I love angry birds and still do but I give them a three star rating because of the    reds mighty feathers levels. It&#39;s still my favorite game and I will still keep playing the game. It&#39;s only one mess up.
1188      Best game I ever played!!!!!!!
1334      #OCD
129       I paid for the app, why are there ads ******
702       Game was fun till the ads I was planning on buying their other games but not so sure now
874       The new levels introduce twitch play, where you have to do things quickly and just at just the right time/way to win. This makes the new levels mostly a frustration instead of fun.
1468      I love angry birds,but im not happy with you.Why do you need Open GL 2.0? I can&#39;t get that because I have an Iphone3G,so now I&#39;m going to miss out on new levels.Please fix that.
712       Please undo last update. I agree w/ other negative reviews. Also the daily reward is gone.
368       The plus side: there are tons of levels.
245       This app is awesome up to a point. I wish this app was easy to win.
571       I think the new update is pretty fun o.o and I like it
1465      Can&#39;t stop playing!
1339      Pop
1504      Awesome game I love it my dad loves it my sister loves it and mom loves it
1053      Never have I met something that makes me so entertained and angry at the same time. Frustratingly addictive- in a good way.
232       Best game I ever played.
33        I enjoys it
695       The new levels are horrible. I am a big fan of angry birds too. The new levels are completely boring.
1474      Hard.
1230      Just like everything else in life. You pays sometimes then it turns out free.  I&#39;m fine with that. Really. 

What I DON&#39;T like is that ridiculous Game Center garbage. I don&#39;t compete with friends. I don&#39;t need to see a leader board. I can&#39;t STAND having to go through that stupid thing every couple days to disable it when I already did that. 

There should be an option to turn off Game Center permanently. Not everyone wants that. 

Absolutely ridiculous. I don&#39;t mind turning it off. ONCE. 

Game is awesome, addicting and plays flawlessly. Worth 6 stars but only giving one until they stop that Game Center crap.
412       The game crashed and deleted all my progress. The update is otherwise good -- not great. There are still tower defense levels on my phone. I hate tower defense games. And the new power of the red bird, directional targeting, kinda goes against the appeal of the original game -- you fire a bird and can&#39;t change it&#39;s direction.
479       More please.
353       Love this game.
1088      I love this game so much!
1068      It&#39;s a nice game, I like it very much.
1097      Two days after installing this, found that my phone was burning 2% battery per hour just sitting there, with all background apps shutdown. Restarted phone and still was happening.  As soon as I uninstalled Angry Birds, it started behaving normally again.  Too bad, was a fun game.
1316      why somebody didnt see this like a good game for relax? with me its real great
367       Wop wop
164       Love short fuse cool update
915       Not bad
501       I can&#39;t even play most of the levels/episodes! Whenever I try and start an episode like &#34;mine and dine&#34;, the app closes out
894       I love angry birds, this update just needs bug fixes. It crashed when I tried playing a level.
439       I love the moving targets! And to all those people that plan to quit cuz they dont like these moving targets...just dont play those! Duh
901       Boring... Dumb.... Not much else to say besides it will be the first level I don&#39;t even attempt to complete.
1069      Awesome
465       This is a fun game
637       The app keeps crashing on my iPod 4th gen ever since the new update. PLEASE fix this!!!
1218      Its the best game in the world
1421      My game crashes at the logo screen. Used to play fine.  Help.
193       I like the game and there always seem to be more levels than I have time to master. This game is heavily marketed to kids - fine by me, my kid loves the blankets and bath towels and t-shirts - but they&#39;ve added videos to the app you can&#39;t turn off anywhere in the settings. I don&#39;t want my kid idly watching cartoons, I don&#39;t mind playing games. Give us the ability to turn off cartoons some way other than putting the iPod into airplane mode! He has learning apps that need the network, which makes this app a pain for me.
775       Please help on the new update every time I try and go on birds of a feather it keeps taking me out. :(
611       I like it.the new levels are relly fun. Still,I miss the old gameplay. You should make it mighty feathers+traditional gameplay.
1270      It was free for 1 day! So what if you paid for it. It&#39;s only a $0.99 app. I bought this a long time ago &amp; I&#39;m not complaining. I think it&#39;s cool it was free for a little bit. It&#39;s a great game. It&#39;s not like they made Angry Birds Star Wars free. (If you like this game &amp; it&#39;s your first &amp; only angry birds. You should get Angry Birds Space.) It&#39;s almost better in my opinion. :)
64        Definitely a five-star addictive game, but the ads have become excessive. You pay for the game, you don&#39;t deal with ads... Just a thought
715       This isn&#39;t a new level, it&#39;s a totally new game. The concept is completely different and takes any fun out of Angry Birds. Change it back to the way it&#39;s been, and if Rovio really wants to keep this &#34;level&#34; then make a new Angry Birds game and add it to the 10 other ones. But leave the original alone!!
888       I can&#39;t play the new part since it keeps crashing on me, please fix it
940       Awesome adicting fun it is the Best awesomest game EVER!!!!!!
953       Just jumped on the angry bird train. Love it!!!
1056      When it shows the loading screen everything turns BLACK and RETURNS TO HOME fix it please
275       Wft??? so many commercials is making the  game slow to load and also makes it slow when playing.

Haven&#39;t you milked this enough considering it was ripped off from castle???

Create something original. Your other games haven&#39;t been such a hit have they?

And why do you want me to register????
820       Awesome update thank you this is awesome I can&#39;t wait for the next levels!!!!!!!
1007      I&#39;m almost out of levels!
756       I&#39;ve been a massive Angry Birds fan for years. After finding no enjoyment in Amazing Alex or Bad Piggies, Rovio decides to force these on me in Angry Birds?  For the first time since the first AB app I&#39;m thoroughly let down. Lame move!  This isn&#39;t AB.  It&#39;s random garbage advertising a different game. No thank you.
199       Please go back to the old way, sorry but the new level are horrible!!
298       This is a fun game and for 99 cents is very entertaining.  However, as you get further into the levels, it becomes pretty obvious that this game was written to keep you from progressing unless you spend hours doing the same pointless task until you succeed, or you pay more money to be allowed to progress with a reasonable effort.  Kind of takes the entertainment out of it.
1103      Its still loading and it has been fir five days. I want it to go away already. Please help. This is annoying even though that i like all the games but if it keeps telling me its installing and it is not thats unacceptable.
544       This is awesome!!!!!
1125      I&#39;ve always been a big fan of the entire Angry Birds series. However, with the most recent updates to this particular game, there is a hugely frustrating glitch. On levels with the egg dropping birds, more often than not whenever I attempt to drop an egg the icons atop the screen interfere and the result is them trying to sell me an eagle rather than dropping the egg. I&#39;ve talked to others who have had the same issue. I really thought that Rovio would be above such plebeian glitches by now.
272       Really don&#39;t see what all the hype is about....my 6 yr old nephew thinks its pretty cool though, so I keep it on my phone ;)
632       really rovio?! angry birds was a great app until the update the new theme is stupid (who listens to polka!) and the &#34;reds mighty feathers&#34; whats up with that
219       Addicted and loving it!!
1517      Love this game it&#39;s dope
1402      No new levels added for months now.
433       I used to like it but not now. After the update I do not like not interested in moving targets and mighty reds feathers.
354       Love the game!
1036      Awesome
1493      They should make a minecraft angry birds
1484      It keeps going back to the home screen when it&#39;s on the loading screen :/
807       When I go to play the game it just take me out please fix and when I went to see a video of the end of the world it just exit me out so fix it !
1150      When yu play angry birds you&#39;re like so123im so happy
1152      Just hard enough to be addictive but not impossible enough to make you quit forever. I love the original thought to the game and upgrades keep the game spicy. Best bang for you buck!
555       HEY what happen to the daily powerup. That&#39;s the last time I will update. If course I could buy power ups. Isn&#39;t that a bit of bait and switch.
290       A+ to kill some time if yeah don&#39;t have anything to do
1250      Well done
1161      Nuff said
333       Running iOS 6.1.3 and keeps crashing. Fix it please.
794       This update stinks. Period
1180      My last review was on the Space Eagle a very bad copy of the Awesome Mighty Eagle which is my latest review and an unlimited supply of them can be bought for 99c so it gets 5 stars but the Space Eagle should be the same?Then I might actually like it. By the way if you are complaining because of the logo for Roviow on the Angry Birds App then stop its just saying who it&#39;s made by( just a picture! ) who cares about the little pic the game is what counts!
837       This is the worst. It wasn&#39;t broken til you tried to fix it. Stinky!
553       No more daily power-ups.  And you don&#39;t get any unless you pay more than what you paid for the game.  New level is not as fun.  I&#39;m disappointed to say the least...
1341      Got it FREE!(;
1011      It fine!
278       It&#39;s so fun that I can Play it all day :)
1383      It crashes as soon as  i get to load the level
1303      Use to love angry birds  
Until new features were install/update 
After that remove off phone miss the begging version of when it came out.
1285      read the required ios products.ipod gen 3-5 and iphones,aswell as ipads only.So shush,iloveoneepublic.-six comments down-
237       Don&#39;t like new levels but still okay game.
621       The new update is crap. I cant play the new missions. Whenever I try to play them the game quits me out an it&#39;s so annoying
1006      I LOVE THIS GAME,but needs more levels with pink bird,and a new world
1482      Just plain fun.
579       I love angry birds. I have them all. But this new level is along the lines of Bad Piggies. Not a fan. Very different game and it&#39;s both too hard and just not fun.
507       angry birds has always been great and even though others tell about problems it&#39;s still awesome.I have a suggestion. It&#39;d be cool to be able to re-play an awesome shot so you can show others those amazing shots.. Just a suggestion, thanks rovio!
209       Whoever decided to make the birds go poof needs to be hailed as a god. Love this game.
1492      Fun fun fun
417       Why do you keep messing with a good thing? It&#39;s not even fun anymore!
383       I dont care if its adds for another angrybirds, i dont want to see them!
59        Can&#39;t stop!
343       I just updated the app and the little blue loading bar thingy on the app itself is stuck on full. I can&#39;t open the app, or delete it. It has just been sitting on my home screen with a blue bar for about 4 days (I don&#39;t remember when the update came out) and I can&#39;t do anything....?!?!
1315      Angry birds is the best game of all time. Nothing can beat or ever will beat it. When it has those days when it&#39;s free DOWNLOAD IT. Still worth it for 99c though. When you download this game you will like it. Trust me. If you don&#39;t, that&#39;s fine you probably didn&#39;t play long enough. But, those who play longer are very lucky and will have a better time. Again I love love love love LOVE this app.
1398      I give it a 5 rr eating! I do because you can just beat all the levels and then you get more and more. It is so addicting. You will love it if you get it. It is awesome! You all probably know how awesome it us. You will brcause almost everyone knows angry birds.
758       they keep on crashing on iPod touch 4th gen
1221      Is keel
1384      I just got a new iPod and when I tried to  download the mighty eagle it wouldn&#39;t let me.( I bought the mighty eagle on my previous iPod).
I&#39;m still using the same account as my old iPod to.
1241      Cool game
811       This app used to be the best app in the store, now look at it. Crashes too much, ads, etc. poor birds...
862       Every time I try to open the new levels, it doesn&#39;t work at all. It just kicks me out of the game
1358      Level 22-2 - plan to get the best score possible on your first try. On subsequent and improved attempts the new score shows, the birds cheer and count 10k for those remaining then?

Nothing.
629       Since te update, can&#39;t even play the new level.  Game crashes. And from the reviews, it sounds like it isn&#39;t worth tr aggravation. PS - bad piggies sucked.
1288      Bring back the old icon. This one looks awkward with your logo sitting there randomly.
1085      I downloaded this and everytime i try to get on a new level the game takes me to my home page!!! Its so aggravatin!!! Ive even tried deleting it and downloadin again but but dont do no good! DO NOT GET THIS APP!!! ITS MESSED UP!!!
788       I have been playing Angry Birds for a while and love it. But the latest level just takes this game to a new level of low.

Honestly, was this designed for a group of semi-literate morons who need to be hand held through the game? 

Part of the fun is getting through a level only to find its good for one star and working to clear it to three. That&#39;s gone. There is no excitement here. 

Pass. The Angry Birds may have come home to roost.
234       Don&#39;t hate I like the app in all but it takes forever to update!
498       Every time I try to get on the new story, the screen goes black and the I&#39;m back on my home screen! Fix it!!!
197       To many adds on a paid app?
1198      Really fun.
1293      well im disappointed i bought this game and the next day its app of the week. the game is challenging... on purpose so they get u to buy the eagle? i think its what its called which clears a hard lvl for u. so its a hard lvl after hard lvl until u break down and buy the stupid ?99 eagle attack. plus they advertise their own games non stop while u play. its a fun game i guess but wayyyy over hyped!
82        The most addictive game I&#39;ve ever played. It&#39;s going to get me fired! But please STOP THE SHOCKWAVE NAG SCREEN!!
1440      Absolutely love angry birds Better than mario!!!!
1142      It crashes every time I go to play a level I love this game and want to freaken play it, it&#39;s by far one of the best games on the App Store now only if it would work -3- I&#39;m using my iPod 4g iOS 6.1
1186      Awesome
112       Has some glitches and some levels seem impossible to win but it&#39;s a great fun ADDICTING game! WOOO
1310      Omg I&#39;m like soooo glad I got this for free!!!!! I love angry birds!!!!!
1234      I just put angry birds on my I phone, it played fine, I closed out of it, and when I went back into it the sound doesn&#39;t work! what happened, how can I fix it.
1300      Good news for who haven&#39;t buy it
Bad News for who have buy it
1027      Angry Birds is a great game and if they made a jurassic park one I would buy it right away!
1299      FREE FOR ALL
681       This update is terrible, it&#39;s not the same game, it&#39;s reworked bad piggies.
311       I can&#39;t get enough of this game!!!  Love it!!!
618       Really do like it!
1062      Angry birds is a awesome app. Make some Batman levels
561       Never mind the endlessly infuriating new levels or the cacophonous new intro music that sounds like it was composed by someone trying to mock carnivals...how can Rovio calls this an update at all? It&#39;s just a horrible overhaul...
454       I love Angry Birds and I always look forward to new updates. Unfortunately, Red&#39;s Mighty Feather is not fun at all. The gameplay is too linear and really lacks the destructive freedom that brought me to love Angry Birds in the first place. If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it.
1139      Amazing game.Youst change the logo :/
352       Used to be a fun game, but the latest updates are so difficult that you will either get three stars or nothing.  Not the fun, easy to waste time with game it used to be.  Update, I just deleted because it always tries to log you into Game Center.  Goodbye, angry birds is really nothing but an irritation nowadays.
1436      Best game ever - angry birds are angry machines
1526      More like shoot randomly and hope you are just the right number of pixels to victory.

Still worth a play through but surprisingly overrated.
1051      I love the challenging levels most apps are not like that! And about all those 1 star reviews those people make no sense i have never seen a play button or black screen... Those people are raging cuz they cant beat the levels.
430       Add the moving parts from reds might feathers into a new section in the bad piggies game
486       On my iPod Touch 4, the app crashes whenever I try to open the new level. Old levels still seem to work OK.
725       ...Hate the new Red&#39;s Mighty Feathers level. No playability whatsoever. Irritating and frustrating to play. This level needs to be scratched. Was this even beta tested or presented to focus groups before global release? This is not up to Rovio&#39;s normal par.
529       C&#39;mon Rovio! You&#39;re already a big company and have won over many fans of your games but really?! Including ads in a popular and paid app like this?!
462       This is not angry birds. Adding the time component makes this no fun. I tried to like it doesn&#39;t work for me.
899       Congratulations! You have succeeded in ruining the Angry Birds game. If this continues through the entire series, the popularity well decrease very rapidly. I hope you learn from your mistakes.
1349      I&#39;m happy that this app is free now, awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
707       The new design is horrible. Give us back the original angry birds. You were the top app for a long time, but then you change everything so that no one wants to buy it. Whoever is in charge of adding new levels should be fired. You remind me of Microsoft and the Xbox One. Are you stupid or something?
711       If I could I would not even give it one star. So boring &amp; seriously flawed play; the timing and limited effectiveness of the red bird makes this game very boring.
1134      Try bringing in different animals to shoot the pigs or something, stop brining in more power ups etc
469       This morning I woke up and found the app on my home screen! I didn&#39;t even buy! It also took the $.99. Also, the new update is terrible, new levels are too easy. Rovio... REALLY!?!
255       This has to be one of the best games I&#39;ve ever played on a mobile device
323       Best app ever!
1228      Angry Birds is getting boring about in-app purchase and It&#39;s very old
434       This game is solid for 99 cents
1231      This game is really fun.
883       I don&#39;t think the &#34;brains&#34; behind the moving target segment really play angry birds. Execution is awful.
1264      lol lo encontre de casualidad y era free
1294      Awesome ;)
1101      Game
789       I really want to play the new levels, but my app keeps crashing!!!
87        Very addicting
1457      One word:
iCloud
266       Addicting but FUN!
288       It get more challenging each new level.
1522      Lots of fun
359       Love to play, challenge myself
1346      Heck yes
1158      A game I was waiting to get! Free? Niceeeee rovio! Keep up the great work!
933       It so much a junk kids should love to learn they shouldn&#39;t be on there iPod iPad or whatever all day they need to learn to get a life
967       I don&#39;t get it. When did PIGS become bad??? The &#34;episodes&#34; are stupid and all you do is shoot things with birds. I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s so popular. It gets boring after a while. Anyway, it&#39;s an okay app.
765       Nearly impossible to get 3 stars and WAY TOO GIMMICKY. It&#39;s so difficult, cuts not even 1% fun!
222       I can&#39;t get all the levels the way I want but I still play it.
114       This is the best game EVER!
1043      I resisted playing this game for a long time but now cannot stop.
1115      I like trains
175       Hard to load sometimes glitches
1248      Enter Code:  0PWCKY
423       Can&#39;t find the new levels!!!!
1206      Good game! And it is free now. Hope some day they will let minecraft be free.
19        The game is fun but some of the levels have some pretty poor design, forget trying to 3 star everything. The IAP pop-ups have really got to go as well. 

P.S. Fire whoever designed golden egg 5. That level is keeping me up at night.
1030      Stupid little piggies! Love this game! Sometimes gets really hard though.
286       Great game love playing it
908       The new update is poop. Angry birds is ok to pass time with, but most of the levels are if not impossible, very hard. I&#39;m on the 6th level of the new update, and I already think that this update is thumbs down. Don&#39;t buy it. You can get a ton of better stuff that&#39;s not a waste of money with 99 cents
452       I absolutely love this game!
1227      This is well, ok:) it is fun but Manuel it could be a little bit more addictive but other than that its great:)!
32        I waited until I broke through #11 to rate this app. When I did succeed, I was nearly giddy with pride. After a few easy levels, I am again practicing my aim. The puzzles are fun and I am looking forward to another success
Yes, I am stuck again. It is way too much fun to quit, thus still a 5 rating!
5 again, yet - I find that an explosion on TV gets me a little excited. That&#39;s new for me.
I enjoy your creativity to find ever more and different puzzles for me. The times I out do myself give me pleasure and am excited to see what is next. Thanks!
Still enjoy the black exploding birds - the finality they offer.
My aim is improving with a better ratio of 3 star efforts. Thanks for the fun!
You still preoccupy me happily! M
I had to give one level to the eagle and have been playing lots of solitaire to help recover. Now I am ready to go back and give it another try. The ability to pick up and retry gives the game yet another 5 stars.
Hi, my aim has improved as has my ability to figure out how to get 3 stars on most all levels. It is fun to get help from the characters with special powers when I am really stuck. However I do not get help unless I
feel tapped out. Thanks for all the fun. Mary
1171      I got mine for free and you had to pay $1 for yours! U mad?
211       I fear my birds are only mildly annoyed &amp; therefore can&#39;t really punish the pigs sufficiently. That &amp; it still randomly crashes.
863       I love angry birds but the new update is awful!
1133      Even my cat likes this game
484       SHUT UP ALL U PEOPLE WHO HATE THIS YOUR GROUNDED FOREVER!!!!!UNTIL YOUR DEAD??????
847       Owned this game for years and loved it.  This new update is so bad I had to check the current reviews since the horrible gameplay left me frustrated and speechless.  All the reviews below about the update are 100% accurate.  It&#39;s complete garage and should ne avoided!
1034      I CAN&#39;T FART ON MY IPOD
There MUST BE A WAY to fart
In the game without in-app purchases
1499      This game is awesome! im so addicted to it! but it!!!! i love the new pink bird though
440       U will always rock!
495       The new level, you have got to be kidding me. I would play electric guitar to show how extreme crap it is. Get bad piggies cuz it rules. Rovio, you just made a new level be crap. I am so top cool.
189       It is ridiculous that the paid version has ads
1280      Fun when it first came out.
980       YOU MADE MY FAVORITE APP CRASH SO I CANT USE IT!!!!!!! i hate you
810       The new update levels are garbage. It&#39;s like a loss of identity, worse than Alzheimer&#39;s but better than Dementia or maybe it&#39;s the other way around... I can&#39;t remember...
1076      The star rating thing today is plain boring I would like to see the star rating music again
406       even two times.......:(
945       This game is awesome and easy and there are so many settings! X-D
84        No challenge, a new game for little kids. Paid for game and now have to put up with Ads???!!!!! Very ignorant!
701       I personally know I&#39;m not with most of the people who wrote the review, I actually like the new level set. It&#39;s more about timing this time than anything else. My initial thought was that I didn&#39;t like it, but after playing more of it and learning the strategy behind it I don&#39;t mind it as much
49        This game was great before it started putting prompts for reviews at every other startup and irritating popups for micro-transactions in EVERY LEVEL.  Dear Rovio; If you absolutely must continue trying to squeeze dollars from your customers this way, at least have the decency to include an opt-out for those like myself who are absolutely NOT going to spend an amount equal to what I paid for the app in the first place just to have some gimmicky and expendable in-game item.  They are making me not want to play your game or anything else published by your studio.
1143      I was so happy that it came free for the week ! But sadly , it won&#39;t download correctly ;( it keeps saying &#34; can not download &#34; this makes me sad !
156       That new uptake is so cool, I mean, the bomb bird is my FAVORITE bird, now add electric and it makes it AWESOME!
1104      This is a fun and challenging game I love it???
1169      when I click on the first level it crashes everytime! fix it please!
429       Can&#39;t deny these birds. Nice update!
1079      When it was just the Mighty Eagle for sale.  As I always say &#34;IAP&#39;s taste bitter,  like ashes&#34; bummer...
845       I&#39;ve had the Angry Birds app for 2-3 years now, but this update is so bad, I got frustrated and just deleted the entire app. There&#39;s zero skill involved, it&#39;s frustrating and no fun. I honestly don&#39;t understand how someone could enjoy this. So long...
1261      You bought so did I? This game is old and if you think it&#39;s unfair they made the game free for a little bit you have problems it was 99 cents
1519      It is awesome It all ways has new updates  like every month!!!
1382      ???????? ???????? ??????????
180       Boo
427       It crashes
1279      The game is really really fun it&#39;s just that I wishes u guys wouldn&#39;t have made it so hard to get the golden eggs like getting 3 stars on two full pages now that&#39;s jut retarted so plz fix it or make it easier to get them but overrall a great game
1192      i like there shout ahhraketkkkaaa!!!!!! coool game! awesome as always
539       Great game that keeps me entertained for hours!  I&#39;m always trying to beat a level as quickly as I can in anticipation of seeing what the next level is like. Highly recommended to my friends.
1173      Read tittle
364       Angry Birds has always been one of my favorite games, up until recently. It has become very buggy and slow, completely unpredictable and unreliable. I still try but it usually doesn&#39;t work. (I use an iPod touch 4g)
If it still works good on the newer devices i recommend this game, and if you have an older-ish device i&#39;d steer clear.
1207      Always a classic.
1229      You could do better  ??
347       It&#39;s a smart phone game that has much fame they call it angry birds
1066      After more than a week since I downloaded the app it still has not installed. What&#39;s up with that
1431      Angry Birds International, each episode is a different city like New York, LA, Hong gong, Paris, WHATEVER!
880       New game play is horrible and stripped of all the elements that made angry birds fun. A disaster.  Finally an update to get me to put away a beloved game.
1203      I really like all of the angry birds games, and I have a suggestion for the next game. ANGRY BIRDS HEROES!!!!!!!
1326      Crashes
614       Love angry birds, but be update is no good.  The new version should be its own game, not an update to the original.   The new format is tedious, slow to restart, and too difficult and frustrating.  Stop it.
592       Fix crashing issues on iPod touch 4
1378      Angry Birds is a highly addictive physics puzzle with a ton of content for just 1$. It starts off slowly, as you just throw red birds, after they introduce more birds, (around level 15) the game becomes more strategic. Highly recommended.
244       So many fun levels! So many different birds!
842       cant play new levels when i open it crashes please fix
562       LOL DON&#39;T DOWNLOAD IT. IT HAS 69 TROJAN VIRUSES. I DID 420 VIRUS SCANS BUT THEY ARE UNDETECTABLE.
1404      I love it! Some levels get pretty hard, but that&#39;s the fun in it. It&#39;s a nice little &#34;finger flicker&#34; game. My favorite bird so far is the black bomb bird. Earning achievements in the game is pretty fun as well. Enjoy!
799       I try to go for something and it always points me away from the target I want to hit terrible update
932       I buy games for just that, GAMES! I&#39;m tired of developers writing games that are sooo closely &#34;joined at the hip&#34; to Apple&#39;s GameCenter to where GameCenter is soo &#34;in your face&#34; to where the game is NOT enjoyable! I don&#39;t do GameCenter!!! Apple refuses to truly disable this thing, but the programmers of games have an option of not allowing there apps to use it! The only internet gaming that I do is &#34;downloading&#34; the games. I don&#39;t really care what &#34;JDoe123&#34; or &#34;ImGonnaWin98&#34; is doing, I just want to take a few mins &amp; unwind! Add an &#34;in-app&#34; option of linking to Apple&#39;s GC or not!!!
768       I do not like the latest level. At all.
1456      Holy freaking crap takes forever to download!!!!!!!
1177      I have Angry Birds Rio Free,Angry Birds Space,Angry Birds Seasons,And now Angry Birds Original
309       Awesom
431       I paid $1.00 for this and and doesn&#39;t even work! Don&#39;t waste your time and money on this
923       When you update this app, installing sequence is frozen.
399       I do not like this version, too much advertising after each round. Also, overhead ad banners prevent you for obtaining a maximum score.
424       If u hate it, then you are going to forget it!
371       Golf game!
55        Fun &amp; challenging
1371      I dont like angry birds much but it was FREE :P
1479      The game is real awesome with the iPod 5th generation
1427      Great little game, I enjoy it with my 4 year old grandson when in a restaurant.
Awesome little app, and cool game.
313       Makes time fly by while waiting in lines. My kids love to challenge me for high score. Good game without the usual gun or blood violence.
965       At first it was fun, now you guys are just money hungry, I mean ads? For something I paid for? Get rid of it!
939       I cannot stop playing this game. Awesome
110       This new update is always crashing... 

Please fix!
1369      This game is way better thank angry birds seasons I&#39;m glad it&#39;s finally free this made my day
721       This should have been introduced as an entirely new (but still crappy) game, rather than as a new &#34;level&#34; with no resemblance to the original formula.  Quit the love affair with the Bad Piggies machines and stick to the original concept.
101       Ohohoh shockwave blow my mind out!! Never knew that there will be a power like that ....... My sister use that a lot of times . It is much easier but some
Are hard ....
1518      Love it! Buy it! Absolute fun!
1092      App of the week I installed this on my iPod. A week later it kept shutting down the game after one play... And sometimes it doesn&#39;t let me play other worlds! I&#39;d rather get something else with my money.
1411      Angry Birds is an overall success but I found some things that were great and others that weren&#39;t. I didn&#39;t get this app to long ago but I had played it before on another electronic device. Here is a brief recap on what you can expect if your going from tablet to apple. 

The UPS

1. This version includes power ups that fire up your bird or rumble the pigs.
2. In this Angry Birds (AB) you have a new level inspired by &#34;Bad Piggies&#34;.
3. AB is the classic fun it has always been.

The DOWNS

1. On the tablet AB is free, but Apple charges $0.99 which is kind of unfair.
2. As well, on my tablet they would give you a free &#34;mighty eagle&#34; everyday but Apple didn&#39;t have that.
3. This had nothing to do with this AB, but on tablet HD cost $0.99 while Apple charges $2.00.

If this is your first ever view of Angry Birds I&#39;d say this is worth it. 

Enjoy!
267       GREAT, on the go game to play. Any time, anywhere
708       Ok, so maybe the new mini game isn&#39;t a very big success, but Rovio is doing this because they&#39;re trying to appeal to a wider audience. They figured, since the game bad piggies was such a hit, they would incorporate more piggie vehicles in a fun mini game. Yes, I know, the levels for it aren&#39;t the best, and its hard as a rock to beat the last level, but its just an attempt to try something new. I&#39;m still giving angry birds 3 stars, since my little brother loves this game so much, but please do better next time.                                            - Lawgamer411
297       I loved AB. I play to improve my ranking even tho I know I&#39;ll never get to the highest score cuz of all the hacker/cheater scores. But this new version is just crap. I still play it, just not the latest v. 

ps: please don&#39;t ruin AB Seasons with a similar version.
552       Same shots often yield different results. There&#39;s no skill involved. I have the nagging suspicion that the game is programmed to make you lose a lot so that you feel like it&#39;s addictive and you are improving.
988       Amazing app half the reason I got a iPod
728       Epic Fail
994       This is a great way to spend five minutes or lose yourself for hours. Kudos.
378       Plz add a super hero angry birds and have batman superman and everyone plz mention me in the game if you make it and have green lantern flash all of the justice league and also please have a marvel one too PLZ and yea thx plz read this -Tarik
287       I enjoy it a lot.
1475      I &lt;3 Angry Birds!!! Don&#39;t stop making new versions!!!
760       I can&#39;t believe Rovio went to all this trouble to turn a perfectly fun and addicting game into a game that should just be thrown in the trash!!!
127       I have enjoyed this game for a few years now up until now. The introduction of ads has been quite annoying and has caused me to not want to play this game anymore. I paid for this game and I don&#39;t understand why I have to be subject to the interruptions of ads during my play. I&#39;m officially not an angry bird fan anymore.
328       Some complain about the difficulty of that perfect hit, but that little bit of challenge and finding it is rather rewarding. I wouldn&#39;t want to 3 star everything right off the bat. I&#39;ve spent a good bit of time on this game, and it&#39;s great! Looking forward to more levels. Not a huge fan of the update before last with the different gameplay style.
293       Best mobile game ever!
572       They miss the mark, literally. It is super frustrating because the aim is off. The bird never seems to go exactly where I want. Maybe the arrow is forcing auto aim or something but if the pig is in the middle of a contraption but there&#39;s some other weak point, like TNT then I want to aim at that. 

Right now it&#39;s essentially &#34;button mashing&#34; throwing as many birds in as fast as possible and hoping a few hit close to the mark. Of course the delays at the start of each level aren&#39;t helping either. Let me start attacking right away, don&#39;t let the pigs have a 5 second jump on me.
757       I think the new idea for reds angry feather is great! It&#39;s more strategic and a lot of fun.
568       I don&#39;t even know what this new update is like, worked fine in the past, now it won&#39;t load on my 4th gen iPod touch. Don&#39;t buy if you have 4th gen iPod
356       0.99 cents for the eagle and it was supposed to be unlimited usage but since the update now I have to wait an hour between uses STUPID CHANGE IT BACK!!!
1272      I love this game!!!
171       I love the game. Great that I can move between iPhone and iPad without losing all of my hard work.  Wish I could do that in space and rio. Really hate the new leaderboard. Really hard to tell where I sit. Wish it would still show in vertical mode.
882       I used to love angry birds but after the new update whenever I try to play the new level the app stops altogether but it works fine for the rest of the levels rovio better fix this soon
483       I HATE Red&#39;s mighty feather&#39;s it&#39;s stupid and it&#39;s a whole different thing then the rest of the game ??
650       Worst update ever. The update accidentally deleting my game would have been more enjoyable.
1301      Yay
210       Rovio should make a angry birds hobbit    :)
627       This game is awsome but the new levels are hard but still awsome!!!!!!
622       This new update should be a whole new game, not an update. It&#39;s completely different, and completely awful
141       Love me some Angry Birds!!!
1106      The best app to have when you are mad just fling the black bird and blow up a pig or six I goten two free sofar this one and rio. Can you make space free too?
1028      Then need to make another free app of the week. It&#39;s been over  a MONTH and still no free app. I hope they make another free app cause I really want angry birds star wars
678       Terrible. Random responsiveness of the red bird.  No interest in completing the levels.
1256      It is amazing game :)) I never get tired of playing this! :))
716       You took a great game that was challenging and ruined it with childish gimmicks. 

The power-ups are ridiculous and boring. Where is the fun in &#34;cheating&#34; 

I won&#39;t be playing anymore.
694       The excitement of a new update quickly turned to disappointment. This is not the game we have come to love. It&#39;s just not fun to play.
619       I absolutely cannot stand this game! I was addicted to the originals but DONE with this ridiculous game. Hope you come out with something new other than Star Wars SOON! Disappointed ):
200       Cool
931       This is the best game I have ever played but I think you should make something where you can make your own levels. That would make this game a lot more fun because once you complete the game there are more levels that you can play that aren&#39;t part of the campaign. That would be cool!
1246      Crashes all the time!  I can&#39;t load the first level; it just shuts down!
773       Works ok with iPhone 4 and IOS6, but now crashes EVERY TIME on 1st Gen iPad running IOS5.1, so, as I said . . .
753       Gotta disagree with all the haters. I love the newest update. Rovio took a risk by adding something fresh and different and it works great. It&#39;s a lot more challenging hitting a moving object rather then something stationary. I love seeing all of the piggies contraptions. I hope Rovio adds more levels to this new update and maybe include another bird besides Red Bird.
1416      I don&#39;t really like what angry birds looks like these days. Why can&#39;t it look like it did when it first came out? Couldn&#39;t Rovio just update the levels? Please bring back that look we had in version 1.5.2 in the next update. And update it soon. Or at least let us play on lower versions!!!!!!!
11        ????If you like this check out Chaos Drive!????

????My invite ID is 787854195????

You&#39;ll see many familiar faces from LOC and GS!  The UI takes a little getting used to if you&#39;re used to LOC and GS.  More active game play.  Use my invite ID 787854195 to receive a SR card.  See ya in the game!
148       Wouldn&#39;t sync on 4G (data worked perfectly when using other apps). All progress was gone until I came home and logged back in to my Rovio account using my wifi, which means all my progress will be gone when I&#39;m offline (on an airplane etc). A sure downside to the cloud functionality. I&#39;ve already had to start from scratch many times when I&#39;m playing on a new device.

One more thing, the original Angry Birds theme song is so much better than the new version. Bring it back!

Update: Thank you for bringing back the original theme song! Love it! I&#39;m upgrading you to 4 stars!
1008      Angry Birds is one of the BEST iPhone apps there is! It is well worth the time and you get so much fun and entertainment from it. It definitely is a must have for you iPhone or Smartphone!
