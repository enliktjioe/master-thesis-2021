142433    This app is just as wonderful as the full web version. It has great interface with Google maps, allowing you to find the restaurant/hotel after you&#39;ve read the reviews.
140161    Very helpful and can get exactly what I want
139985    Recomendo.
140169    not as easy to use as desktop but still good
141373    Incredibly good!!!
Exec Chef Randy...extraordinary culinary skills

We caught fish by day and THE chef prepared them 4 different ways...all exquisite!!

Asst manager Jerry made our experience super!!!

Our waiter Jacob was remarkable...service, humor and professionalism !!!

Thanks very much
140576    This is my go-to for tips and reviews.
140223    App keeps on improving, I use it all the time, helpfull!
142535    ...it&#39;s been very helpful with booking a room, dining, etc, the few times I&#39;ve used it.
140372    Cannot flip through photos.
Cannot page forward in saves.
140852    ...tripper advice for food &amp; lodging, especially in smaller towns! use it/contribute all the time. we wanderers have to help each other out...
142130    Love it!
142691    Hooked on Marahau neat little cafe on the beach. Casual seating. Wonderful food. Try Lamb shank. Desert special. Service with a smile.
141135    Works great!
142673    Two major annoyances 1) set the app to use my current location then enter a search term and it zooms out to the entire world! Why the f would I want to know about an attraction in Germany when I am looking for something on the other side of the planet near my current location?!  2) after zooming in back to where I actually am and picking something out to see more information the &#34;back to map&#34; button goes back to a blank page.  The map refuses to re load forcing one to start completely over again. Other than that, terrific.
142036    Definitely the best app for travelers. You have the options you need when choosing a place to stay and the ratings are pretty reliable. Glad I chose it.
142234    Great app; easy to search and I love the save option for things you like!
142526    Like a pocket version of the website.
142843    Great for traveling on the go, but lacks features to access your own personal profile, reviews etc.
141206    Use this whenever I&#39;m traveling and find it essential for judging suitability of restaurants and hotels.
141289    Excellent coverage of Kyoto.
142974    Love this APP. Good info. Thanks
141637    Works wherever we go in the world.  Currently trying it out in Korea! Most entries for places are in English. Though as you would expect many are in the host countries language.
140265    Very helpfull
140742    App final shows the cuisine which previous versions did not. Great improvement and gives one to select wisely their choices to eat
140278    I found so many great hotels restaurants and things to do on this app. I use it now as  well to share my experiences to fellow travelers
142327    Excellent app for planning a quick getaway, and flexing along the way as plans change. Reviews always include some grumpy people and some extra happy people, but they do help a lot.
141340    The place is a DIVE. Based on Trip Advisor reviews, we made a reservation. It was so bad we just walked on our money.
I will post pictures later. Horrid. I don&#39;t know who wrote those reviews. Scam.
140009    Struggle with the iPod and iPad apps includes the flashing of the screen anytime I type or enter a command(iPad) and when trying to book a hotel it won&#39;t move beyond the check-in and check-out dates(iPhone). Perhaps bc they&#39;re booked solid. But I don&#39;t think so. Just some minor improvements needed.
141390    I have written a couple of reviews with it and it is easy to use.
For hard to find places it takes a little more effort, still  easy to use.
139993    I have just started using the app for the vacation we are on in South Africa. The restaurant reviews are invaluable in navigating the options available in the area. So easy to use - has become a valuable travel tool - wouldn&#39;t leave home without it.
139917    We arrived at dollar with a 2 pm reservation plus the rapid service I signed up for last week. It&#39;s now been over an hour in line. The placed is mobed with hundreds of customers in line yet very very few counters open. It&#39;s about 40% running. There is no where to sit and crying babies and disappointed families in every corner. Food is on the floor and the place is complete disarray. I will never rent of the dump again. I would rather walk. Actually if I had walked to Pasadena I would be almost there. Plus the staff are rude and ignorant. No compassion for the customers standing in this never ending line rather than be with their families for Xmas. My daughter and I flew in from New Jersey to visit my mom. She has a whole dinner planned tonight. Unfortunately we will be here at dollar waiting for our pre reserved rental car. Rush hour starts in 30 minutes, that will end any chance of seeing my family tonight. Shame on dollar for not properly staffing their rental car center during the important holiday season.
142091    I&#39;m a flight attendant and do quite a bit of traveling. I love this App when looking for hotels in areas I&#39;m not familiar with!
141136    Very useful for gathering information to assemble dates, celebrations, trips, you name it.
141569    I like the app but it has some bugs that are annoying, when I do a search and then refine the search it limits the options of filtering for distance or rating and I have to then do a new search to get the other to work, also when I go into a specific restaurant then go back out to the search page it takes me back out to the wrong search,
Needs work to be as good as it could be.
142753    This is a great way to find out for locations that we are trying to visit, you can save so many problems reading the  comments!
141547    Great information for places worldwide. 
One of the few accurate guides for lodging and dining in Mexico
142332    Sort of like TA reviews.   Some are good ( look for reviewers who have posted a lot in the forums and also those who give evidence that they actually travel). Yelp, chow hound, que are much better.  TA is okay on hotels, not so great on restaurants.  Ignore attraction reviews, head for forums ( again, some are good, but....well, if you are relying on TA reviews to plan trips, you might want to supplement with other sites). Regular TA much more usable than app.
141122    I love this app!
140029    Aplicativo super ?til, com varias dicas importantes e a opini?o de cada consumidor. Recomendo
140544    Tips, reservations, directions... I&#39;ve been using TripAdvisor in all my trips for a long time, specially when I visit new places and need updated and reliable info. I also enjoy contributing with reviews!
140821    The redesign of the app is perfect! Keep up the good work.
139832    The recent update/upgrade has resulted in an app that&#39;s very slow, often freezing up and generally a pain to use.
140571    I use this app to find accommodations and restaurants on all our travels.  It&#39;s invaluable to have this wealth of data at my fingertips; making our travel experience all the better as we focus on hotels and restaurants that get great reviews.  I also use this app to write reviews.  I love being able to quickly write a review with my real-time thoughts.
142096    Easier to get reviews here than Google. Google doesn&#39;t have much. Need as many reviews as possible when choosing a hotel especially. Some reviews are silly, like personal complaints or an impatient person... Just use common sense when reading and judging
142521    Excellent app for travel
140226    I love this app, works in all my favorite cities. And the huge selection of restaurants is amazing!!!
Trial and error in trying those places is fun!!!
140026    This app is fantastic! The reviews are very helpful and I can always find great food no matter where with this app!!!
142762    Just by chance we happened by this darling little place, that had 3 empty tables, 2with reservations. The server was extremely busy with 30 people to serve and did a fabulous job. She recommended the 2specials plus their 2best sellers, we decided one one of the specials and one of the favorites. Again, fabulous ! Then came the dessert crepe, absolutely declious ! Thinking of going back for breakfast.
140069    It&#39;s great I like writing reviews and reading we&#39;re am gonna go next
142864    This app is so helpful! The reviews and descriptions have not steered us wrong!
141788    Super !!! Very useful !!
142066    Amazing!!
141236    This app is way better then others I&#39;ve looked at, there could be improvements but nothing substantial, I love the things to do category!!!
142788    Great resource for all sorts of travel information.
142826    Everything I need for travel at my fingertips.
140918    ?!
142367    This app is a &#39;must-have&#39; for iPads!
141766    Wish could find another app similar to this one with attractions
142023    So awesome! Very helpful
141207    Great app for travel. Obviously every place isn&#39;t going to appear, and you should know better THAN to expect everything to be included; moreover, don&#39;t expect all reviews to be completely accurate or grammatically correct...
142581    Mto bom!!!
142627    Such a great app and easy to use! I use it to plan all my trips.
142313    I was go to this app for reviews very helpful!!!
140689    I love my trip advisor app and use it daily! I am VERY disappointed the menu feature is not on the new update! Bring it back!!!!
140072    I just downloaded this app. 
Logged in.
Can&#39;t find reviews that I know that I&#39;ve written.
As a new owner of one of the establishments, it&#39;s important for me to see ALLLL of the reviews that effect my business!
142922    I like the website but this app needs help. Saved locations seem to vanish, it doesn&#39;t say what you&#39;re logged in as, and now it seems to have forgotten our username. Upgrade needed!
140426    Sorry, but there was absolutely nothing wrong with the old version.  Then they tried to do an &#34;ios7 friendly change&#34; and honestly, it just blows.  Also, I can&#39;t access my personal info to see where I stand with contributions and whatnot.  Love to see that available instead of having to get on the Mac/PC ...
142877    Great app, accurate and helpful. Easy to navigate
141251    Trip advisor is an awesome tool to share with others experiences that you&#39;ve had to allow others to see how a hotel, attraction, etc...is before they make their choice. So thank you for having this app!
142487    The iPad version of this app needs work.  Message notification is almost non-existent and its impossible to access any &#34;saved trips&#34; or add anything to a saved using the app.  Also, when doing a hotel search, you get far fewer hotels than when using the web site!   Also, there&#39;s no way to filter out hotels when interested in only B&amp;B&#39;s.  Since TripAdvisor is owned by Microsoft, I&#39;m not surprised that they don&#39;t want to make the iPad app better!  Particularly now that they&#39;re pushing their own tablet.
141618    Great app for travelers!
142136    Very convenient, useful info and easy to use.
140321    Incredibly slow and sluggish app (iPhone 4/iOS 7.0.3). No possibility to select New Zealand dollar as a currency.
142553    No se equivoca, la mejor referencia antes de viajar!! S?per recomendado
140136    Enough said.
140202    Genco is an old world Italian restaurant, the sandwiches are the best in town. When you walk in you feel like you are being greeted by family, and the soup tastes every bit as good as grandmas soup. That is because everything at GENCO&#39;S is homemade with love! A Must have is the wedding soup. I went in and had a small bowl, I was so sorry I didn&#39;t get some to bring home. 
I live in Boca Raton, and I drive to Fort Lauderdale just for one of there great sandwiches. All are excellent, hard to recommend on over the other. So keep going in and decide for yourselves!!!

Address for Genco is
257-B Commercial Blvd, Lauderdale By the Sea.

Also in case you are wondering I am not related in any way!Just love this place :)
140863    Could use a few more filter options (a la the yelp app) , but overall great app and great site with many more, and more discerning, users as far as I can tell.
140622    Trip adviser helps me find all my info when traveling. 99% of the time it&#39;s right on.
142073    I love this app
141990    I love this app. It offers everything from the website all in the palm of my hand.
141512    Great!
140146    Can&#39;t sort for anything - price, distance, rating - anything!! Defeats the whole point of the app!
140520    This was one of the two most used apps on my recent trip to Germany!  Keep up the great work.  Kudos to the dev team
142594    I find this App very helpful
139859    It&#39;s so easy to find terrific restaurant!
139954    I&#39;m a big fan of TA. I also like to see pictures of places before going there in addition to reading reviews.

Seems like TA is not really making a lot of efforts to clean up pictures before they&#39;re posted. Many are upside down or sideways.

Not good!
140258    Spend some time planning a trip with this app and you will know where you are and what to do when you get there.
141302    Great way to find some things to do with good honest reviews.
142258    I downloaded the city app while I was travelling and was very happy to find that the maps worked even without using data.
141731    I am glad this app is available on iPhone and iPad. Makes it easy to search places and see what others think before you go. Lets you write your review right away! Don&#39;t have to wait until you get home. 
Love having the ability to rate places and have your opinion read by others.
141050    I only used your app because, I thought it would show me excellent hotels that are smoker friendly! I found this is not the case &amp; feel your misrepresenting your app!
142190    The only setback is that not all proprieties are list in this app.
140414    I use it every time I travel,,,
142803    Gran cantidad de informaci?n a un toque de pantalla!
142220    I travel for a living and this is one of the apps I can&#39;t do without. Nice job all round!
141107    I find tripadvisor very helpful when trying to find restaurants in particular.
141983    Nice for travel!
140747    App works fine, but I&#39;d like to be able to fully view my account (contributions as an example) on the app. Also, the rating functionality is limited on the app versus the website - the app only allows you to give an overall rating and doesn&#39;t break it down further.
140085    Have had for several months now. No crashes, no locking up. Shows me what I need to see.
142835    Trip Advisor is a great service and they have produced a great iPad app to go with it. As a pro pilot, I use it all the time for hotel selection and things to do around the world.
141861    The only way to search and research travel.
140238    Easy to use app; very resourceful.  Amazingly accept bad reviews of places which is especially helpful.
140515    My &#34;Go-To&#34; app for restaurant reviews. For a serious foodie this app will help you to avoid the dogs in town and discover the real gems. You can vote with your dollars and this app. Gotta love the power of social media to reward the best and ignore the rest.
140071    The new version is much neater and easier to use.
141377    Our best friend abroad.
141872    I have tried its info a couple of times and it always turns out very reliable. Great service with this app. Just give it a try.
141011    Great app for on the go!
139949    I really love
142181    TripAdvisor, what would we do without you ?
Great app. Thanks !

Only recommendation: sites you get to through clicking on embedded links (restaurants or hotels) should be on Safari or another browser, not embedded.
142965    Easy to use updated info at hand
141155    This app is awesome!!
142749    Love this App. Found some restaurants in my town that I didn&#39;t even know about and a couple that I thought had closed but just moved. The Things To Do tab gives some really good ideas for a vacation and also just around where you live. This is one of my go to Apps when planning anything from a trip to a date night to a day out with the family.
140113    Restaurants, hotels, attractions, more. Favorites or &#34;must do&#39;s&#34; can be added to &#34;Save&#34; list. Have a question?  Ask it in &#34;Forums&#34;.  Get it. Use it.
142751    The app works very well at home or on the road, anywhere with an Internet connection. IPad is my travel medium and this may be my most used app and easiest to use.
141438    Great useful information !!!
142173    Awesome App!  It has helped me find so many restaurants in my area that I never even new were there!  Recommend it to everyone.
140225    Never make a reservation without checking TA. Always check reviews on restaurants, hotels, resorts, or attractions. Never worry about the results as the members tell the truth. There are differences of taste and level of service expected but you can read a few reviews and get a feel for what to expect.
142551    Made planning my vacation very simple. Great information
142730    I&#39;ve discovered that a lot of phone apps don&#39;t compare to the full website in terms of functionality. That is not the case with Trip Advisor- it works just like the website.
140579    The best and the best of these programs I&#39;ve seen far too diverse. ????
142783    TripAdvisor is the place I start my travel planning long before I make a booking. I can get great ideas from others experiences and the hotel reviews by others give a variety of perspectives which I find helpful.
142031    We use to book our vacations and reviews from travelers are very helpful.  App works great!
140033    Wonderfully handy app while traveling! Review your faves or use as a discovery or decision too or tie breaker!
140018    This was a great way for us to plan a trip to Martha&#39;s Vineyard. We found out all we needed to know before we went. Very useful app!
140779    Just got back from a trip in Spain and had numerous problems with this app.  It worked differently on the iPhone versus the iPad.  It kept locking up, which meZn I had to constantly &#34;hard restart&#34; my iPhone 5.
140832    This app, will be useful on my motorcycle trips.
140931    Consistently use trip advisor for all of my trips everywhere I go.  Wouldn&#39;t go without the app or the city guides.  Taking a star away because it keeps asking me to rate the app!   Annoying!!
140301    It has the option to save things which I like about. Places to see, forums, places to eat.
139867    I use this site every time I travel and to learn about new places nearby. I consider it my most useful travel/dining app by far.
140757    The map does not display all my saved locations. In the past version it worked fine.
How can I get my saves to show on the map?
139866    Use Trip Advisor the time, very helpful.
141481    I can&#39;t figure out how to use it. Unable to access reviews, change information (user name, photo, etc). May delete it. It&#39;s too bad, cause I love Trip Advisor (website). ??
139878    I use the attractions part to see best things in the area. Works EVERYTIME.
140066    This is a great app. It is very helpful if you &#39;re in an unfamiliar place. Love the reviews other travelers give. You can find different venues in almost any city.
141322    Would be nice to see locations on a map and view restaurant menus.
141031    We don&#39;t book anything without checking Trip Advisor.  And, it provides a great opportunity to give feedback on our experiences.
142672    I have used trip advisor on several trips- its reviews and recommendations have been an excellent compass to more enjoyable experiences.
142468    I&#39;ve utilized trip advisor as my new &#34;go to&#34; place for honest, impartial reviews. They haven&#39;t let me down :-)
141474    Nice guide
141551    Helped me plan my trip to Germany with ease. Amazingly easy to use and has a great user community
141228    If nothing else, this gives me a good place to start my searches. The reviews are usually up to date so I can trust the opinions to be accurate of the information i need now.
142252    Better than any tour guide...for all pockets
141780    To whom ever needs a concise informative and a very interactive tool to help make that crucial decision of where and how then the Trip Advisor App is the one.......and i hate apps...so try it...
139885    This app and website are my best friend. This should be the most trusted site ever! Candid comments are the most helpful when planning a travel and this app/site is the only place I look to, use, and trust! Love trip advisor
142056    Very helpful
142720    La mejor aplicaci?n para buscar bonitos lugares
142485    This is the only must have app if your an adventurous spirit! Love to travel and this app makes it even better!
141865    Just what I was looking for!
141128    Es una web muy completa que yo utilizo siempre para encontrar hoteles,tiene la ventaja que tiene fotos y comentarios de personas normales muy validos.
Para monumentos y cosas que ver es muy ?til tambi?n.En los restaurantes no me vale mucho, hay muchas opiniones de anglo hablantes y de low cost travellers y su gusto es muy diferente del m?o.
140718    I love trip advisor &amp; until today I absolutely loved the app. I used to be able to click on any category of reviews for a hotel without having to read all 300 of them. It is an app - Good, bad &amp; ugly should be easily accessible independently for a snapshot of pros &amp; cons. They have made recent changes to the app which make it impossible to read a category of reviews. No longer quick &amp; easy to access in a snapshot when booking a hotel. If you are going to make changes, make the app more efficient, not less so. Change it back!
140387    I use this all the time when we are traveling. I don&#39;t let one bad report influence me as they are very subjective. This new Trip advisor is great.
140491    I love using the TA App whenever we travel.  The information on dining and lodging us a great help and the unbiased reviews are welcomed.  I find that I rely on TA quite often.  The info provided is usually right on.
140286    Love being able to pull up the restaurants near me when on a trip. My husband and I always try to hit restaurants in the top 5 wherever we go, and they almost never disappoint!
141040    Os coment?rios s?o muitos pr?ximos da realidade . Tenho conseguido muito boas dicas
141779    I wouldn&#39;t even CONSIDER booking a hotel room without consulting this amazing app.  No where is there so much info. And photos of where you are considering to stay.
142255    Place I go to get the scoop no matter where I am
141174    Awesome when traveling
142701    Great app to have!
141368    I wish Trip Advisor would improve their app. It&#39;s frustrating to use - can&#39;t filter easily.  Basically, the app is not intuitive.
140114    Consensus averages gives good sense of what to expect. Reviewers are generally truthful and steer you straight.
142666    It really does exactly what you need it to...advise you on any trip to anywhere !!! I love it
140106    I downloaded an update and now the flight search doesn&#39;t work. I appreciate the easy access to reviews of restaurants and other places. Really what I liked about the app is how accurate the flight search has been. I&#39;ve compared Trip Advisor to other flight search engines and it always found the best deal for me. Please fix!!
140245    Nice app. It looks good and it runs smooth
140183    Please hasn&#39;t changed since 1975. Only two restaurants and the food was horrible. If you budget is low and your expectations are lower it&#39;s the perfect place. You get what you pay for.
140605    What happened to the menu feature? And used to have a link to restaurant website.  Miss those features!!!
142204    Spot on, Tripadvisor!
140370    love this app and it&#39;s so helpful when I travel!!
141036    Este sitio es fabuloso, siempre ha sido ?til.
140293    Can&#39;t sore reviews by star rating, lame.

Keeps demanding to post thugs on my behalf and won&#39;t let me sign in via Facebook when I click no, lame.

I&#39;ll still use it, but under protest.
142117    Nice!
139891    Every update is worse than the last with this company.

UI is terrible and now we have a continuous never-ending looping login everytime I try and write reviews
142779    The best resource for finding a decent place to stay. I have never been sorry for having read the reviews here. You have to be logical when deciding who to believe, so here is my formula:

What is the over-all rating?
What is the opinion of those people who stayed there recently?
What are the complaints?
What do you want from your stay?
How much do you want to spend? 
Is it worth it?

That formula has always worked for me,  and I depend on Trip Advisor anytime I am unfamiliar with a destination and need a place to stay.
141048    ???????????? ??????
140925    Would be a complete embarrassment even for a high school project. Barely ready for alpha.
139959    this really is a very good app for the ipad.  one thing that annoys me is that the website is so well laid out and easy to navigate but the app takes a little learning to try and figure out where things are.  its not as obvious as on the website.  a little user point of view engineering would be great.  it really is a useful and well functioning app though.

i am a senior contributor and i love reading the reviews of others also.  trip advisor has proved to be a reliable source of information for me.
140343    I am a big trip advisor user, and am happy they have an app, but it is *useless* if you are in a place where you don&#39;t have data!

For example, I&#39;m in Thailand. I have wifi at my hotel, make some plans using TA and save some places. Walk out of the hotel and it is all gone. Not only are the saves not available offline, even the restaurant that was on my screen gets wiped out and I&#39;m back to the home screen when I go back to the app a few minutes later.

If you are going to go through the trouble of making an app, take advantage of what a native app allows you to do, like keep state and store data!!!!

I should also be able to:
- write reviews for uploading later
- add new places that are not in the TA database (this part is super frustrating when you are off the beaten path).

I look forward to seeing the improvements.
139860    Love this app.  It rarely crashes and is loaded with lots of great info for trip planning.
141196    Information is current to what&#39;s online and easy to navigate.
142501    We have used trip adviser on the web for many years. I&#39;m so very glad this mobile app works just as well.
140939    Will be back. Good service and food!
140147    Very easy to locate places to eat, play, and stay
140369    Update 11/05/13:
Now a bloated piece of junk. &#34;Advisor&#34; does not mean book hotels, see menus, or any of the other crapola that has been added to this app. Time to locate a better app than this one.

Previously: 
Cannot add a business
Cannot report a name change for a business

Does not understand that a &#34;nearby&#34; business that is 25 miles away is not nearby, especially in a city like Chicago

Biased toward certain businesses, skipping past local businesses for &#34;trendy&#34;, or &#34;favored&#34; businesses. Advertisers perhaps?
140007    Needs work
139967    Great idea
142065    We&#39;ve used this app successfully in the U.S., Barbados &amp; Costa Rica and it&#39;s been ultra helpful. When visiting foreign countries, Be sure to see how many reviews are posted for a place &amp; the overall rating before you &#34;pull the trigger&#34; &amp; give them your hard earned money.
141037    I love using trip advisor and the app works great!!
140591    This app is very convenient not just when traveling but also finding out cool stuff in your home town.  A must have for any one who loves planning trips. You won&#39;t be disappointed
141646    Great ap!!
139815    Trip Advisor was very helpful on our trip to OH.  I wouldn&#39;t want to be without it.
142026    Easy to use on the iPad or iPhone for traveling and quick searches for restaurants. For trip planning its better to log in on a computer to see the full application.
141528    Ideal para viajar en todos los sentidos...
141333    I use TripAdvisor to checkout restaurant  and hotels. I regularly write reviews. Great aide to proving leisure time activities.
142191    Excellent. A must have.
141837    Love the regular website and the app makes it twice as easy to find all your travel info!
It&#39;s a great reference  for trip planning, day tripping or local exploring!
142486    Great app
140905    I&#39;m surprised at all the very positive reviews of this app. It seemed to me that this app is not at all designed well for tourists. Here&#39;s why:

1. There is no way to save location for viewing offline. Your favorites are saved, but accessible only when you have access to the Internet, so if you&#39;ve looked up a restaurant, but don&#39;t remember exactly where it is, you&#39;ll have to use international roaming just to check the map and see how close you are.

2. The search function does not allow you to apply new filters while keeping your previous ones. If I searched for $ and $$ restaurants in Prague, and then wanted to narrow the search to exclusively Czech food, for instance, it would erase the price limitations and show me $$$ and $$$$ Czech restaurants.

I ended up relying much more on recommendations from friends and blogs, which I then loaded onto Apple maps, which I could access offline. If only Yelp would go international!
141272    This Is a must app if you do a lot of traveling.
141256    Travel a lot for work in the US and now globally. Also love to travel on my own time off and Trip Advisor is great. It has a lot of information. It is very helpful - from St. Louis to San Isidro. I highly recommend it to novice and seasoned travelers alike!  It is also easy to use and has a lot of really useful functionalities. Just remember that the reviews come from users so you should read a few before making a decision - and even potential check another source just for reference. And remember that it doesn&#39;t work if you are off line! So make sure - especially if you are traveling somewhere where you may not have data service to have a source handy that isn&#39;t dependent on being &#39;connected.&#39; But then again - when are we ever not connected any more!
140508    At least old app version had a distance filter, even if it was not user friendly/intuitive. Hopefully you have a quick upgrade in the works... And make sure you have actual users test it for intuitiveness. Not just your own people who already know the software and won&#39;t be able to spot problems as easily.
139847    I was surprised how many timely and accurate reviews were here for Europe and Mexico.
142018    Its not like any good native app. there is no proper navigation animation and flow. zero smoothness, slow, worst design.
142377    I really like this app! Very accurate when it comes to prices.. Booked my first flight through Trip Advisor yesterday!! Thanks!
139829    Badly done. Example: no coffee category. Cafe doesn&#39;t find coffee shops. One coffee house is listed as fast food. There isn&#39;t any fast food category in the app with which to find it again! Totally incompetent, these are extremely obvious and basic failings. And stop asking for location turned on!
139908    I use this app all.the.time. Very handy and accurate
142631    Decent app. Except for the pesky &#34;review reminder&#34; that kept popping up.
140745    simple and to the point directly, love the pointing to my destination feature
140248    Now that I have the ability to review places right on my iPhone, I use my tripadvisor much more. And I&#39;m very satisfied.
141303    So handy, so insightful, so on target!!
139964    It&#39;s a great way to find a new food place even if you have lived there forever, I guarantee this app will find something new for you to try or see. 
I like that you can post photos.
142171    The ratings from users are so helpful.  Love the mapping part too. Just needs to work with iMacs or another map program to get from point to point
140104    Good app!
141610    What&#39;s not to like? Everything you need to know is all right here in one app - from reviews to prices and comparisons - you can plan your entire getaway without getting a headache. The only reason for not giving five stars is sometimes the app crashes without warning - not a huge deal, but definitely annoying. Overall, a wonderful app that can&#39;t be beat!
139999    Great app.
140322    Just like American Express, don&#39;t plan a trip without consulting this app. Invaluable information.
140994    Love the ease of use of the app.
141208    This was my favorite app and I use it a lot. However two features I use often are broken in this version:
1. Near me feature: after selecting a restaurant and returning to list it loses the sorting by distance an it reverts to sorting by rating. Only fix I found is to go back to home screen.
2. Filter by distance and sort by rating. Used to be easy, but can&#39;t figure out how to it anymore.
140055    Great design and functionality
142189    Good reviews
142731    Using it to read up on the places we will be going both before we booked for the reviews, and after booking for tips and tricks. Mobile access to the forums is also great.
142253    Uploaded the app no problem, from there out - all problems. The only review I&#39;ve been able to write so far has been this one boo!
141554    Recently injured in a car accident, I can&#39;t sit at the computer for hours researching information for my up coming trip and was worried I wouldn&#39;t be able to gather enough to do the kind of thoroughness I like. This app makes it possible for me to do so on the bus, or lying comfortably in bed. Thanks!!
142257    I love Trip Advisor and I love being able to use many of the web tools on mobile.  However, in the first 10 minutes of using the app I found two major glitches - 1) when hitting the back button from a hotel page, it doesn&#39;t respond for upwards of 10 seconds, and if you hit it more than once before it loads, the app goes back to the home page and you lose your search preferences; 2) when changing check in/out dates, you can&#39;t go to another month; when you hit the &#34;next&#34; arrow, it flashes and then goes back to the current month - so don&#39;t plan on checking rates or availability unless you&#39;re traveling in the next few days.  Very poor design and easily preventable.
140805    It&#39;s new and improved and so smooth to use, highly recommend If you like traveling! 5 stars!
140533    Why can&#39;t I filter restaurants by cuisine anymore? I hate it. Switching to another app.
142607    I always use this to find restaurants near me when I am traveling.  Works great and reviews are usually on the mark.
140416    Quem ja conhece o trip advisor agora pode usar ele direto no iPhone com as mesmas funcionalidades, muito pr?tico e eficiente!
140654    Searched one city and now it is stuck there, i.e., can&#39;t change cities. Worthless!!!
140870    This app contains so much useful information it is truly addictive!
140253    Such a handy app no matter where you are traveling!
142297    I get great ideas and reliable reviews from Trip Advisor. I trust it more than almost every other ap on my phone.
140413    Use it for every trip! Couldn&#39;t live without tripadvisor!
140294    I absolutely love this app. It is so helpful when traveling, and also helpful at home to see what other people are saying about my favorite restaurants.
141902    Need to improve functionality on this app. 
Can&#39;t vote reviews helpful.
Can&#39;t read your own contributions or see badges.
Have to scroll thru all the pictures to get to the end. Would be nice if you could skip to the oldest/ newest Pics without scrolling thru each one. 
Back button needs work as well.

Otherwise, good for the basics!
141480    Very helpful for honest information
141269    Overpriced. Portions were a joke. Much better restaurants to choose from
142024    Getting use to newer version still like the web site better.  So I&#39;ll bump up to three stars
old review below...
Updated version is terrible, let me have the old one back please

We love this app and take it everywhere we travel. It helps us narrow down where we should eat, stay and play,
as sometimes we can&#39;t seem to make up our minds.  Everywhere we have chosen off of Trip Advisor has been spot on, and when we travel we want to have great experience and Trip Advisor and fellow travelers make that happen! Thanks and fellow travelers keep up the great writing and sharing!
Still love this app, used it 4 times just today!
142970    Easy to use and very accurate. I always go to trip advisor to see opinions whether the are good reviews or not. Thanks for the great app
141722    I was hoping to replace Yelp and Foursquare with Trip Advisor. Disappointed I won&#39;t be able to. The deal breaker is you can&#39;t check in on a location.
140054    I love this app and it is has a lot of helpful information on it.
140420    Since I did update unable to even open app!! What is going on??
139989    This app was almost perfect. The mapping was a little klunky so when it said the update made that better I upgraded. There is no more sorting by price so I will stop using this app and slow down on my reviews for TripAdvisor. This is a rare misstep for them.
141222    I love this app
142075    Very helpful!
139935    Beautiful app , that help you to choose based in your preference ...a lot of details...I really like it....
142525    Excellent app!
142599    I like this app.
142556    Very helpful in finding out things to do!
142188    I use TripAdvisor on my phone, iPad, and computer whenever I&#39;m looking for a new restaurant or hotel. I trust the ratings from other reviewers, and I write many reviews myself...this app makes it easy to keep connected to this community.
140124    I used trip advisor on a recent vacation. We tried several restaurants based on the user reviews. We didn&#39;t have a single bad meal!  This app is easy to use. It made my vacation a wonderful experience. I will use it on every future trip.
140044    I love this app for planning trips and finding things to do in places I visit. Easy to navigate and lots of information and pictures provided!
140966    This is a great program.  I have been using Trip Advisor for a while and really appreciate the feedback from other travelers.
142305    I&#39;m looking in a few upcoming vacation spots and this app helped a lot with my itinerary! Great app!
142669    I don&#39;t leave home without consulting this site.
142589    Great app that is very user friendly.
140003    Great app! Helps you plan a vacation or a simple weekend with honest reviews about companies. I use it very often.
140129    Keeps crashing
141729    This app even if you select view all saves still forces you to only see saves for one location at a time. I like Google + Local saves option much better. Outside of the saves and lack of professional reviews (I hate relying on user reviews) this is the most useful travel review app.
140247    Love everything about this app
140493    Love this app!!!
140694    Easy to navigate and responds well to actions indicated by users.

Perhaps over simplified but more impressive is the GPS element, a nicer attribute that the website lacks.
142976    App is easy to use both for writing reviews and reading them.  We used recently for a very impromptu trip to Florida and was extremely pleased with the ease of use and the quality of reviews.
140417    Used it to research hotels for an upcoming trip to Singapore.  The app has a few features I didn&#39;t even see on the website.  I like the app UI and ease of use. However, the traveler submitted photos are slow to load and sometimes the app seems to lag.
140061    tripadvisor is very good app i recommended that any one need any thing from shop to activities downloaded and enjoy it
142256    Restaurant ratings are spot-on, hotel ratings very accurate....finding that I depend on TA more and more whenever I&#39;m on the road. Solid app.
141477    I never travel anywhere without first checking out trip advisor
142049    Nice to have on your phone when traveling
142917    It&#39;s great to get other users perceptions, even better when they leave insider tips
140777    The latest version has an intermittent bug. I typed a complete review and then clicked the submit button. The button flashed and that was it. The app never accepted the review. There is no error message, and everything else seems to work. I clicked Add Photo and added one to the review that was never accepted, and it appears to have accepted the photo without the review, which is still visible. I even received an email thanking me for the photo but did not receive one for the review. I guess I&#39;ll reboot the app and try again.
141159    Running my own business this app is ideal for keeping me connected with customers to see what we can do better or just keep doing!
141857    You can only have horizontal use, which I never like to use. It doesn&#39;t have all of the features of the website: for instance, on the app I can&#39;t look back at what I previously reviewed. It&#39;s just not as good as the website; no reason to download.
142722    Always happy with TripAdvisor recommendations
141185    I&#39;m a traveler from way back, whether on business or pleasure, I may not have time to squander. This app helps me select the best places to see and things to do when I&#39;m out and about.
142389    I love Trip Advisor. The wealth of info alone would make it wonderful - but what a bonus to be able to review places you have been. I always consult Trip Advisor whenever we are planning a trip. It&#39;s great!!!!
141604    I love trip advisor and I was glad to see an app. Unfortunately I delete it within 10 minutes. It froze a lot and I kept getting stuck only in certain cities while searching for hotels within a small country with no option to go back. Shame.
141221    Excellent application for search in the area of Tourism (hotels, restaurants, attractions, etc.)
142578    This app helped me a lot and I really like it. I really and truly recommend that people should buy this app.
142973    Baj? la aplicaci?n para revisar en mayor detalle lugares y tipos de hoteles que estaba viendo en la versi?n web, sin embargo no encontr? ni siquiera la Villa que hab?a encontrado en el web. Por otro lado, no encontr? donde cambiar la moneda y me aparece todo en euro. 
En definitiva, pareciera servir cuando uno tiene elegido el hotel para s?lo revisar como les pareci? a quienes antes estuvieron en ?l....
141695    If I don&#39;t take a look at this App I think about the place twice.  Great App and features.  Two thumbs up!
140609    Much better after latest update, had trouble saving reviews until updated!
140825    The former app was so user friendly and laid out well for navigation.  The update, October 3, is more cumbersome, harder to get back to home screen, has no &#34;back screen&#34; button that I&#39;ve found.  Map isn&#39;t even as easy to see and read.  Am so tired of companies &#34;updating&#34; their apps just for the sake of updates!
140137    We use Trip Advisor all the before and during our travels. Most of the commentaries are very helpful in making our trips successful.
141117    Great!!!!!
139990    Simple as that. There&#39;s not much to say because that&#39;s all I need in a travel app like this. Very transparent as well!
141078    I really have no words! Speechless. It is such a great app! So helpful! I love traveling and I just can&#39;t stop using this to do a the research! Congrats! And thank you!
142323    Great app so far. Very user-friendly. Love the option to &#34;save&#34; places to go to. Overall - terrific! Only thing I wish is that I could &#34;favorite&#34; form threads. That would make this app absolutely amazing.
142021    But why not add a feature that allows users to share newly discovered thingstodo.
141431    This app is amazing! I would recommend it to everyone!!
141964    I&#39;ve been using this app to plan and manage an overseas trip. It has Ben great so far withstand couple of minor issues. When left running in the background on some modes, I think it keeps location services on which seems to be draining my battery faster than usual. I&#39;m not sure if it is that, or in just using it more than normal. It&#39;d be great if there was a way to see my &#34;saves&#34; sorted by distance as well as a way to mark them as seen. Finally, when I&#39;m using this while traveling, I really don&#39;t want to use international roaming to upload a review, but remind me later waits about 5 minutes and them pesters me again, so a star off for that.
141677    Pretty easy to use and navigate. Pls add portrait view for iPad.
140436    The best travel site for planning your stay.  Good reviews by serious travelers.
142623    Easy to use gives good info on things to do, food, and lodging. For sure can&#39;t beat the price ...
141713    I am sure even Aliens would use this app when traveling on earth. If you wan to enjoy your trip, use this App, Period.
141353    I like the reviews and I find them very helpful. They come from real people and I often submit my own review.  I find its a good way to let hotels and Resturant know how they are doing. I find a lot of hotels and restaurants read their reviews and respond. I find that powerful.
141693    Different views show different information which often requires digging in different places to put together a complete picture of ratings, price, menu, etc.  Tripadvisor is great but the app has a ways to go to catch up with the website.  It feels like sections of the app were written by different people and then kludged together.
142863    Has a terrible HTML look to it, super slow, and not as detailed as the website. Maybe it&#39;s because I usually travel in Asia, but it would be much easier - and faster - to just use the website instead of the app!
141085    Excelente para buscar hoteles y turismo
141210    The TripAdvisor App is a shorter and better way to look up something instead of going onto their website and wasting more time! Sometimes, you can&#39;t always find what you are looking for so you have to go on the website but, it&#39;s the majority. I do all of my bookings with TripAdvisor through the app or through the Internet and it still works very well! Great job!!!
142155    We have used this app to plan for special occasions and fun outings! Has been a great resource!
142934    Must have for traveling
141257    Great app, no problems
142875    the app does not allow guests to &#39;like&#39; or find helpful the reviews they are reading.  As a reviewer,  that is my reward.  It allows me the opportunity to see what readers like or find helpful. Please find a way to bring this mainstay of your website to the app/mobile version.  Your reviewers need it!
141843    Tons of info on the smallest towns in France. Great.
140272    Tripadvisor is like having a local guide with you
142088    Great app. Very helpful
142128    This app will save you time and trouble to avoid the troublesome places.
141781    clear. organized. rich.
140081    Love this app. Always find where to go when you travel. With many people on it, it&#39;s great to find local places to eat &amp; visit while you are away.
141166    Planning a trip somewhere I&#39;ve never been and enjoying to helpful info and the many comments from people who have made the same trip. The communities / forums really make this an all around excellent travel app and website.
140011    Love it
140613    I love this app!!!
139903    Search function not working properly. Shows only a few, apparently random restaurants in area (Rome) no matter what I try. Frustrating. Have gone back to TA using Safari.
141914    I like trip advisor, one of the better reviews around. The app should be tweaked as it has some flaws.
141466    Love being able to look up the specific areas I&#39;m visiting and have LOCALS chiming in too!!
142697    For the most part it does what I want tripadvisor to do, help me choose what I want to do, where I want to go, where I should stay when I get there and what I should put in my belly.

What I don&#39;t like is that it makes me re-log into tripadvisor from my iPad each and every time I use the app even with remember me on. It will also freeze or crash semi-frequently.

Other than that it is pretty ok.

Picture it this way, my unstimulating review of the tripadvisor app is pretty much what the tripadvisor app is, unstimulating.
142127    The app, itself gives you access to virtually everything you need to know to plan your trip.  For a particular site, hotel, etc. for which you need to know more, the app has a built-in web browser which takes you to iPad-friendly web sites.
142314    Good app
142426    Love it. Very useful and informative. Highly recommended download.
141981    Many functionalities (e.g. Ratings) are not working properly on iPad.
141441    I really think you should improve the app , because when I searched for Qatar only 4 hotels &amp; 4 things to go to appeared whereas there is alot of places to go to in Qatar and obviously there are more hotels then 4 .
140917    Easy way to write reviews and find great places to go and the best places to eat.
140604    I can&#39;t leave a review on my iphone. The &#34;month visited&#34; feature doesn&#39;t work.
Otherwise it&#39;s great when traveling.
139840    Excellent for finding places of interest at your destination, love the map with the attractions and the routing via google maps
142871    Very helpful when traveling. Love it :-)
142199    I love this app. Makes things so easy.
142192    We took a trip and used trip advisor to find the hotel and places to go. We had a great time. Took me a little time to realize I could not book hotels, but otherwise was invaluable for our trip.
141509    Love the app but got noting on Ireland pleas help me
141542    Great to look for places And interesting things to do whileb ravelling
140833    The MySaves feature isn&#39;t working properly. I click on it and the hotels I&#39;ve saved are gone! It says I have to sync my trip advisor account. I never made one so all my saves are gone! Again a crappy update thanks again trip advisor.
141852    It&#39;s really helpful. Don&#39;t miss this app if you&#39;re on a long trip.
142240    Muy ?til aplicacion, con bastantes datos. Recomendable
140974    Hemos disfrutado de una estancia excelente. 
Tuvimos la gran oportunidad de  compartir un excelente servicio en el Club Premium. Muy de especial Sandra Sanchez. 
Gracias por su excelente servicio.

142634    It does exactly as advertised. I&#39;m a pilot for large U.S. airline and I use this app all the time. It just works!
141949    There was nothing wrong with the old version, and this new one eliminates one of the apps most useful features: previously your saved restaurants, hotels, etc, were automatically sorted by location, now all of them are shown at once which is really confusing.

True you can ask to see your saved hotels in say only Chicago, but if you then want to look for your saved restaurants in Chicago, you have to do a second sort.  This is a pain especially when you are in a location with a poor signal.

If you don&#39;t have this app, it&#39;s certainly worthwhile, but if you do take a careful look at the latest version before you upgrade.
142195    Great app!
139882    It is a very goop application for tourisim
140300    Reviews and recommendations have never steered us wrong on this site!!!
142365    Great app, just love it.
141763    I haven&#39;t had a problem using this app. My only issue is that I can&#39;t figure out how to look at my own reviews after i&#39;ve posted them.
139846    I use this app almost daily. I trust the reviews because unlike yelp or some of the other review forums there is this spam like quality where people are just shooting off at the mouth not so on trip advisor. Plus the coolest new feature is adding your Amex card for special benefits and offers
141424    I use this app all the time to get fast opinion so as not waste time or money in a tried and tested restaurant or hotel. It is easy to use.
140696    I just plainly love this app. It helps me in selecting the places to travel, eat, stay. Reviews are useful and the app is user-friendly.
142114    I use the app all the time to find anything I need about traveling. The reviews have always been accurate. I would recommend this app to everyone.
142390    Used it everyday on my travels.
142004    On every trip we take I dont go anywhere until I check Trip Advisor! It never steers me wrong and it is so helpful to have. i love reading everone elses reviews and then checking it for myself most of the time they are on point others not so much but its good to get pointers so we dont get blindsided. I love this App
140316    Great app anywhere, I go I can read other options. Before I make up my own.
142100    Something must have changed with this app? I like it, and never did before. It&#39;s very user friendly, easy to say if a review was helpful and to write a review. Is that is what is new? The ability to write reviews on the app?? It&#39;s great, whenever on my iPad will use the app over the website.
142748    Nice app.
140158    Can&#39;t figure how to sort by price. I will use another app to search for Hotels.
140347    Example: went to Seoul, told a friend (native of Seoul) that I planned to dine at the #1 ranked restaurant...he had not heard of it and was very skeptical.  Later, we stopped by the restaurant to find the longest line to get in restaurant we had ever seen.  The line went down the street and around the block....amazing! I have the video on my phone to show people who are just learning about Trip Advisor.  I appreciate the reviews from people and try to contribute whenever I can.
140485    Latest version crashes on launch on my iPhone 4, iOS 5. Please fix.
139981    I use this app from beginning to end when planning a trip or going out of town for business.  So convenient and easy to use.  Love the rating system!
139939    Love this app
142421    I&#39;m enjoying it so far hopefully when it&#39;s time for me to go out and do stuff ifs worth using!! :)
141838    Excelente App para b?squeda tur?stica. Great app for travelers
140231    Com certeza um dos melhores aplicativos/sites de dicas de viagens!
140397    Every trip starts at tripadvisor :-) Forums are very helpful, too.
141882    Great reviews from the US to wherever!
140396    What a great app. Easy to use, info is accurate and everything you need to know as a traveler or tourist!
141189    Works well when you&#39;re looking up places on the go. Solid reviews.
141002    This is wonderful app to take with you for travel ... And, to use at home. Just got back from Chicago where we used this to find attractions, restaurants .... And, more importantly, directions! Don&#39;t  leave home without it!
142561    Great!
142268    Now that I have found Trip Advisor, I do not do anything travel related without consulting it first.  If you do any traveling, for business or for fun, you must check out Trip Advisor!
141689    I like how the map figure integrates with the locations being reviewed to give you an idea of where they are located. Also like how you can zoom in and out on the map to modify options. Having noted these positives it would be nice if the app allowed one to vote for helpful posts. Overall this will be great for use while on the road to complement the full web version.
141777    Good app that works well except I have found multiple wrong addresses on it
141591    1. ALWAYS have to login again even when checking &#34;remember me&#34; (so I never login)
2. Type too small to read in reviews so must use iPad&#39;s accessibility feature - why can&#39;t TripAdvisor allow stretching and zooming in?
3. All the email links included in Trip Advisor forum posts are not linkable

Bottom line - I love TripAdvisor on the WWW but only tolerate it on the iPad for the convenience of accessing a quick list of restaurants in areas where Yelp doesn&#39;t have a strong presence.
141242    I don&#39;t have a personal assistant but  my work requires a fair amount of travel.  This app makes me feel like I have an assistant taking care of my travel plans!  Love it.
141744    Esta bueno
141717    There does not seem to be any way to search or view Bed &amp; Breakfast lodging options from the iPad app. 
Is Trip Advisor going hotels only?
139991    It&#39;s easy to pull up nearby restaurants and hotels, or by city, and easy to write reviews. 
I find that reviewers are generally too generous with their ratings and comments. Maybe I&#39;m more critical. 
It&#39;s difficult to figure out the order in which places are listed:  is it by distance?, rating?, price?  I&#39;d like to be able to sort by rating, in most cases. 
All that being said, I&#39;ve been using it constantly on our recent trip.
142676    Exc
141751    Great app to go to a place you never been, gives you an idea from other people experiences
141536    I never realized that so many people do a lot of research of Hotels prior to booking. Hope all my reviews will help everyone out!!!
142790    Great app, works great for all my travels for both business and personal. If I want to take a customer out for lunch or dinner I know exactly where to go, and know that it will be great.
142908    Excellent tool for planning a trip, the reviews people post are always very high quality and helpful. 

My nay complaint is the maps, they&#39;re sometimes hard to use (if you move it a bit ti see whats around, it will automatically change the results to new search results in that area...). They&#39;re also not very detailed, street names etc. But nonetheless very good and useful, thanks for the great, free app TipAdviser!
141930    Easy to use. Nice app
141265    Trip advisor is a very helpful tool for those who like to travel, yet do not know the areas they are about to visit. I love the fact that it lets you upload pictures of places.
141452    ????? ???? ??? ????? ????? ???
139895    Very good for the iPhone
142098    Is quick, easy, but above all is the cheapest way to fly
141025    In a trip to Florida, I relied on this app for all my adventures, and I was not disappointed. It has stuff on the big touristy cities and on the small local stuff too. Love it!
142349    Trip Advisor provides very useful information but extremely difficult to search. For example, I am vacationing in Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo  Mexico.  I set the filter to Zihuatanejo and I want to find information on Manzanillo bay in Zihuatanejo. The app takes me to Manzanillo Mexico. I want to search for a restaurant in Zihuatanejo by name. It shows me every restaurant with that name in their system around the world and then I have to search thru the list to find the restaurant I want. Even though I set the filter to Zihuatanejo it combines the Ixtapa restaurants in the list. Very awkward to say the least. It needs a great deal of work to improve its functionality.
140229    The app is limited on functionality
140895    Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Trip Advisor. I am however very disappointed in the app. It&#39;s very laggy, and crashes every single time I try to scroll through any pictures. It goes to a black screen and just stays at that black screen until I turn my phone off and on. I use the app to read the reviews and scroll through a few photos, so it is very aggravating. Overall the app lags constantly, and crashes often. I am holding out on deleting the app in hopes of an update that fixes all the problems, but until then I&#39;ll be sticking to the website version of Trip Advisor.
141578    The app really helped us navigate where to go - and what to avoid.
142282    As a frequent business traveler, I always check tripadvisor before heading into a non none restaurant and find it to be spot on most of the time.
141688    Have used it many times for domestic and international traveling
142152    Whenever we take a trip anywhere Trip Advisor is the first app or website I visit. We have found many different and interesting places we wouldn&#39;t have found otherwise. Thank you Trip Advisor.
141993    I almost always look at reviews before I travel for work or pleasure to get a sense of how the properties are performing. Doesn&#39;t take long to sort out which places are doing a good job. One bad review does not a bad experience make but if you see several it might be time to re-think your plans.
140185    Good app but I wish it had all the details when adding a review like it does on the website.
142489    I have used on several trips now to evaluate lodging, dining and things to do. I&#39;ve found the reviews as a whole very helpful. I would like it if there were more subcategories in the things to do such as museums, zoo, sports arena, etc.  An option to change each list hierarchy for distance, price, rating also would help.
141518    Thanks to the staff and management for making my 1st trip to London so fabulous! From uniforms (doorman especially) to spotless rooms and common spaces it was unexpected quality and service.   Dinning is A+ but being from the US I didn&#39;t get the pork and beans on the breakfast buffet. Try a steak sandwich in the tea area it&#39;s wonderful along with the cute and  delicious little bites they serve with tea. Too posh. No need to prebook tours in US the Concierge staff can do it and know more about the sites.
Basically, I loved this place, so I&#39;m planing a trip to London by myself and feel totally secure,safe, and familiar with the area and hotel! Cee ya soon.

142689    Love taking trips with the family and this app helps full those &#34;what are we doing today?&#34; questions.
141622    Love it. It&#39;s been a very convenient addition for me in my arsenal.
141402    This app has been very helpful whether going on vacation or just trying a different restaurant around town. Definitely has made vacations more enjoyable!
141442    I really enjoy trip advisor and being able to have a good app on my iPad is wonderful. The app has all the functionality of the website and as long as u create an account (you can link one to Facebook), u can access ur saves anywhere. Definitely a must have if u travel a lot.
140542    Prior version was better.  Now the links are gone and there is much less versatility present
140684    The newest update seems to only want to link you to book a hotel room. You can&#39;t click on the ratings review to skip to just the good-bad-terrible reviews. At one point trip advisor was the only site I trusted to give real reviews. I don&#39;t feel the same anymore. It really is sad.
142784    Love it!  Makes finding things to do and places to stay and eat easy!
140457    I love the actual tripadvisor website and never choose a hotel without checking TA first. That said, I hate the app now. I like it before the OS7 changes. Now I hate it. Wish I could undo the so called upgrade.
139956    Very nice app for check restaurant hotel and more, very attentive !!!!
141035    Great app very helpful! Very easy to use!
141562    Finally a tool that helps you find places to visit.
141321    I definitely appreciate all of the reviews posted, both positive and negative, to get a sense of the restaurant &amp;/or hotel I am considering, so I can make an informed decision. I also enjoy being able to share about those places I really enjoy...and those I don&#39;t!
142523    Love it
140752    Great app to write my reviews on! Very user friendly and easy to navigate.
141019    Crashes, and returns inaccurate results.
140793    This update negates the usefulness of the previous app. It does not know where yo are at any more and does not provide location service. 

In the previous version you could scroll the map and see your desired categories update on screen. This version no longer does that. You have to type in a cityor location. Totally useless when yo are traveling
142737    We love to travel both locally and internationally. Use this app every time.
140760    Finds nice restaurants:)
141367    Their data base of hotels and things to do are growing every day, lots of great information and tips for planning a vacation.
141972    I have been using this app for more than a year , and definitely is the best travel app in the market , is the only way to know by fellow travelers what&#39;s happening in the city your are visiting related to hotels, restaurants , tours etc.

Keep improving !!!!
141397    We don&#39;t use any other review site.
142583    Great app to have when planning or on a vacation
It has great options on family fun stuff to do
139992    Great app to get info on any place you want to travel! Accurate reviews from other travelers..and great recommendations for thing to do. I use this EVERY time I travel.
140759    That&#39;s what I say
141760    Love this app it&#39;s been so helpful on my last 3 vacations
141682    We use this app in planning our trips and while on our trips for restaurants, clubs and sightseeing! Great help!
142104    Love Trip Advisor.  We see and visit so many places we would have missed if not for Trip Advisor.
142844    Good so far
140264    Works fine, no complaints here
140310    Facebook login required to save or sign in. That takes an above average app to below average.
139998    I just started using this App and the 1st thing I noticed is that under restaurants&#39; filters, there is a large selection, but Kosher isn&#39;t one of them. Since it&#39;s the one that matters the most to me, I am rather disappointed.
141860    Needs a portrait view.

Add features available in the full web version such as adding the &#39;like&#39; button for reviews and adding details on the reviewers.
142174    I like this app. It helps when your on vacation looking for a place to eat.
141010    Not as good as the website! Hope to add more filters (such as dining options), also clicking &#34;back&#34; after choosing a restaurant clears the previous filter and I get the main list!
142030    We travel the world a lot and this is the perfect app to help us identify restaurants and hotels. We find it far more useful and up to date than the guide Michelin. We have found the reviews all very useful and accurate. I would strongly recommend it
141504    Love using it to read reviews if unknown restaurants before we go.  Sometimes difficult to navigate.
142218    The app and mobile presence both need help, fast. The inability to do much of anything other than browse is tough. For people searching its great but the reviewers matter too. At this point mobile needs to be just as capable as desktop. &#34;View Full Site&#34; means not enough focus on mobile. Please increase features!
141627    Great app, but viewing photos are a pain to get out of. It seems to stick after  touching the &#34;Done&#34; button. iPhone 4S.
140257    The handiest app alive
140826    A functional and stylish update to one of the best travel tools around.
141104    We like to see what people say before trying a new place and this helps greatly. You can sort from the good and bad reviews and then decide.  The app gives a blank green screen sometimes when posting a review and some other glitches but don&#39;t let that stop you.
140359    I tried to write a review on a restaurant, and the app kept asking me to sign in with Facebook, which I did several times. It never would let me submit the review.
140208    Fast and accurate. Real nice app.
141312    Prices listed never match the actual hotel prices. Don&#39;t waste your time with this app!!
141086    Easy way to rate and write reviews
140254    The new app seems to be based on html5. While it&#39;s functional but it loads very slow and looks ugly.
139977    Useful and speedy. But must have Internet.
141725    I use the site extensively for planning trips like the one we took to Hawaii. It helped us pick our hotel and the restaurants we ate at and the excursion we did.
140888    Works well, wish it was more integrated with google maps
141517    Presently on vacation and TripAdvisor has been exceptionally useful in identifying good places to eat. Starting to rely on it more &amp; more.
140950    Can&#39;t even write a good review cause I have not been able to use the app w/o it asking me every two seconds to rate it.
140929    Classified Chinese restaurants as French.  Ridiculous.
140964    Any time we try someplace new, whether it be a hotel, restaurant or other large attraction, checking Trip Advisor is a must!  I appreciate the honesty of others and the ease of navigating through the site.  Thank you!
142391    Nothing else needs to be said!
141443    As an RV&#39;er, this app is of great useage.  From finding businesses to grabbing a meal on the run, this is a fantastic tool.
142074    Great trip tool. Thank you for the initiative.
140862    Love this app! Can visit the great places no matter where i go wz real reviews from ppl like me
141923    Just started using Trip Advisor &amp; love it.
142150    Trip advisor has been easy to use   Making it an invaluable tool
139845    The interface is easy to understand. Great application when travelling.
141352    This app has been very helpful on my honeymoon search. It would be nice to be able to enlarge the photos though. Other than that, it&#39;s perfect.
140353    Excellent!!!!
141655    I use this frequently especially when traveling to find reliable food and fun options.
142398    ???????????????????
139988    I use this app a lot to write reviews, they need to have the option to add pictures from your mobile device. Other than that it&#39;s very reliable!
141879    Just beginning to travel and visit various restaurants and Trip Advisor has been extremely helpful in our selections. Majority of the comments critique level of service, cleanliness, price, kid friendly. Thanks to all who take the time to input positive and negative comments. Sometimes I have gone against the comments and wish I hadn&#39;t.
140111    I travel throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia on the regular monthly basis . I have tried many of the travel guides written up by many notable magazines and were given high recommendations but none tach the usefulness of the tool . 

Some aides focus only in certain regions but even then I have found this tool to provide better advice not only in the same region but worldwide . 

I am a believer and a constant user now and would not leave home without . 

I would most certainly recommend this to anyone .
140140    Great information is available.  Wish maps (locations of newer hotels were updated more).  Also would love to have an individual resort map of all the resorts available to view.  Would be great if age of property and renovation dates were included for hotels, too.
141823    Just started using the forum and I&#39;m finding it very helpful. Forum members seem to really want to help,
141079    Not having a lot of time to plan vacations I rely on this app for all my planning and have found it to be really reliable.Time saved good choices and enjoyable times have resulted.
140094    I always check Trip Advisor before I consider hotels, attractions, restaurants. It&#39;s invaluable and a great resource. Can&#39;t go wrong with it.
142438    The Trip Advisor iPad app lacks a lot to be desired for me. It&#39;s a better experience on your web browser. On the iPad app you can&#39;t hide the left side bar which takes up too much room after you find what you are looking for and you can&#39;t enlarge the font or stretch the screen on the app either. The browser experience has way too many pop out windows on Trip Advisor web site. 
Other than the listed items we love Trip Advisor, all the customer reviews are great when visiting a place you haven&#39;t been before.
5 stars if you make changes to the above listed items.
140755    They are trying to push vacation listings, but you can&#39;t drill down to a neighborhood . Orlando is a big area and you get a zillion listings that come up. I need one near a particular neighborhood. You can&#39;t search for that and going through all their postings for Orlando isn&#39;t feasible. Use airbnb instead. They know what they are doing. You can put in any address where you need to be and listings pop up all around it. How can you miss something as simple as this? Those that have a listing on trip advisor must be losing out. I think they are now too big to care.
141131    Una excelente app para los viajes
140411    Fantastic app! Always useful and accurate
141456    I  downloaded trip advisor App for my iPhone. It shows information about large cities, places, destinations however, Information about hotels, restaurants and newer places are not in the data. It really did not help me much.
140580    What a great aop
141606    Works well and helpful
140382    Help! Been re-installing/deleting it.. Still wont let me open the app! Please let us (old iphone users and old iOS users) use this app! Fix it for us!
141405    I like Trip Advisor, but their app is slow and feels buggy.
If you have the patience to navigate through its, um, &#34;quirks,&#34; then you can get to their good info.
140409    I&#39;m in charlotte, nc.  I selected current location from the opening screen then selected restaurants.  The app pulled up the &#34;Current&#34; restaurant in Washington DC.  I then tried to sign in and the app ignored my constant clicks on the sign in button.  I then exited out of frustration.  I&#39;ve used the app several time since it was updated and have been frustrated with the navigation every time.  Please fix this thing.
141171    Everything you want from TripAdvisor
139888    I check Trip Advisor before booking any hotel or trip or for advice on where to eat while we&#39;re away, and what to expect.
I&#39;ve had many successful, adventerous trips thanks to Trip Advisor!
141417    I love having this both on my iPhone and iPad to reference when I&#39;m on the road.
139863    Soy fan?tico de esta app cada vez que viajo, el ranking de restaurantes es magn?fico.
142108    I respect the opinions of others and this is the place to go for opinions
140427    I hate the new changes since the iOS7- it&#39;s not user friendly, keeps freezing and won&#39;t let you see pics. Please bring back the old version, or fix this one!
140506    I am a senior contributor but lately when I try to open TripAdvisor on my IPhone 4; it starts to open for two seconds then I am back to my icons screen.
141283    It is interesting but I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s seems to be extremely slow and apparently you cannot upload images with iPhone devices.
142825    Your best trip companion !!
141188    Very handy app especially when I haven&#39;t exactly planned what I want to do in range area that I am visiting
141003    So easy to use. I love it. And mostly the reviews turn out to be extremely
Credible.
141540    Great app for Europe, not as useful in the USA
142810    Works like it should. Handy app to have your fingertips.
140217    New version is terrible. Hate the design.
141580    Very user friendly app.
142797    Simple interface encourages me to write more reviews!
142078    Any thing that can help me find a bar is awesome!!
140500    I found amazing on my india trup
140326    This is THE main source of travel info I use when planning a trip, whether looking for lodging, restaurants, things to do, nightlife or just tips about a destination I&#39;m not familiar with. Probably my favorite feature of Tripadvisor is how current (fresh) the information is. You choose, a travel guide that was published several years ago or Tripadvisor with reviews posted this vet week! Makes a huge difference. Love this app and I never leave home without it!
142541    I love traveling its helps me a lot and I help people too!!!
141083    No matter how many times I restart the app and apply so it sorts the results by rating, the app continues to sort the results by distance. Absolutely worthless to me when there are 700 results within 10 miles and I&#39;m looking for the top 10 results.
140342    If you want the best traveling guide app then look nowhere else. This will really make your travel in any country in the world the best travel experience. I ALWAYS depend on this app it become like a part of me.
142736    Awesome
142182    Very bad. Not a native iOS app. Takes long to load and isnt responsive. Wont recommend
140644    I&#39;ve been using this app for some time now. I love it when it works and I love doing reviews but tonight I&#39;m in Billings,  MT at the Spring Hill Suites. I&#39;m using near me and it don&#39;t show at all.   I&#39;ve stayed in Billings many times and this is one of the better hotels - it shouldn&#39;t be this hard to rate something.  Guys I know you can do better than this
142340    Trip Advisor is great for traveling and even better with the app on the go.  Highly recommend.
141056    I have used this for vacations to Paris, Miami, and Cape Cod.  Always find fun things to do and good food.
141052    This is the first place I go to when planning a trip
