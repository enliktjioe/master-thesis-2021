3132      If you copy text from a PDF and paste it in body of an email it puts each word on a separate line. This &#34;feature&#34; just recently started within the last week or two. Used to work perfectly before. Please fix quickly. I use this a lot.
2065      Just speak clearly,and  voila&#39; you  understand!
1932      It immediately closes to the home screen every time I try to open the app. Boooo
2942      This is the best application that I have ever used.
1972      No veo lo elegante en ella. Adem?s ahora es m?s dif?cil acceder a tus archivos hay que seleccionar como favorito un archivo para que lo descargue y despu?s quitarlo. Estoy decepcionado.
2115      Crashes every time I&#39;m using it
2626      my old iPod was stolen and broken but luckily all of my old pictures were on Dropbox! thanks so much!!
1968      I can no longer access the app after the update. Once at the unlock panel, the number pad doesn&#39;t allow input to unlock.
2150      How come it takes 10+ minutes to load a simple document? I just want to open it, edit, send, and etc.
2069      Autocomplete, autocategorizing, and checking off items make this very useful.
2351      One flaw is the fact that its almost impossible to load mp3s or WAV files over data. It will play for a second or two then say its unable to load this file. Fix please!
2988      I always use dropbox with Upad, but this newest version can&#39;t open PDF files with Upad anymore. plz update as soon as possible.
2190      Ack! I need to do user testing with a clickable PDF this week and have ALWAYS used Dropbox because it&#39;s been awesome in the past. Now though, all my clickable PDFs don&#39;t work - nothing is clickable and my hotspots don&#39;t work. This is super frustrating - especially because I found nothing else that can compare to Dropbox and really rely on this feature to work! PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP. Right now I&#39;m hating the app because you guys took away this core piece of functionality that I desperately need, but PLEASE add it back soon and all will be well again.
2100      For some reason in today&#39;s schools we now get virtual text books that are in PDF form or just saved on a drive. With his app I can now take my government book with me everywhere I go and never have to worry about it!!! So much easier for me to pull out my iPad in a class than my laptop to do the work really quickly. Thanks so much!!!
2557      This app is wonderful and makes doing things like typing up assignments sooo much easier because you can revise, edit, and print wherever you are whether its home or school!
2249      Has a lot of hidden charges. For each step you wish to do with you document the payment of an extra charge is requested.
2664      It&#39;s and effective link between devices but it crashes every other time you open it. Frustrating to say the least.
1663      Use it probably everyday
3308      Just like Mentalthaker says,after upgrade I can&#39;t see my PDF!
Please fix it ASAP!
I am depending on it!
2001      Having airdrop added to dropbox was the best thing you did!
2418      We need Dropbox Windows 8 app, with Modern UI design, please.

Thanks.
2566      That&#39;s all there is to it. It&#39;s great.
2914      I use this app every single day. You can sync all of your photos (automatically with camera upload), store all of your music and iTunes library, videos, documents, and simply everything you could possibly think of!!!

Dropbox has changed the way I store and access all of my files. This is a MUST HAVE app!
2331      This is how I get files to my iPhone apps. It&#39;s indispensable and the desktop app even runs on Linux!
3238      It is like USB for me , I love it hasaaaaa and free . That all we need and I really appreciated it .   :)
3006      If can check or not check to opload camera it a best apps.
3194      The app crashes after last update please fix
2077      Miles ahead of Clear.
2082      What else to say .... Simple, beautiful and very functional. I just love it.
2972      U guys saved ma life!!!!!  when my iPod got reset because of the passcode,  It erased all my photos which I was sad,  that&#39;s when,  before my iPod got deleted,  I had the app DROPOX!!!!! It turns out that my iPod didn&#39;t erased all my photos because Dropbox saved them!!!!!!thank u so much!!!!
2934      O.o As the title states.
3243      This app won&#39;t open now! All my school and work files are on it!
1568      It is just great, and name says it all &#34;fantastical&#34;. Thinking about using this as default calendar.
3459      The latest revision (as of 10 January 2013) loops endlessly when trying to upload a 411KB file.  Had to email it to move to another device.
2985      I love dropbox because I can get to things from any device. Especially helpful when I am on vacation. The problem is it won&#39;t update on my iPhone.
2346      Can&#39;t you leave well enough alone guys &amp; gals. Recent update on my iPad 2 now causes the app the not load at all... Start it, goes back to home screen. Deleted app and reinstalled. Nothing! Please fix...
2983      This must be THE most updated app in the App Store. Week after week after week: &#34;bug fixes and performance improvements&#34;. My suspicion is they rev the app just to keep reminding you it&#39;s there.

Back off guys, or actually explain what you are improving.
1595      ...
2058      Every little annoyance has been fixed. Full photo view. Also new look!
2475      It&#39;s not able to save small video clips ... But it&#39;s ok !!
3329      This is not a review of the Dropbox service (which is great) but of this app, which can use a lot of improvements. The single most frustrating thing about it is that it displays only a dozen or so characters in a file name. Since I have thousands of files, some with long and descriptive names, it is impossible to find what I&#39;m looking for unless I download the files to the iPad one by one. There is no way to resize the file list to make more of the files visible. Why not?
1790      I use this many times a day and think it is wonderful. However, please create a format for the iPad.
1638      Love Dropbox. Easy to use and convenient across my iPhone iPad and MacBook. Only thing is they need to offer better customized pricing for upgrade plans. 100 GB is nice but an average user may only need 25/50/60 etc. how about pricing that meets low level user needs not just 100gb or more.
3087      I have many folders on Dropbox, among them some 200 photos I have taken, collected, uploaded. 

Every single .jpg in my dropbox has mysteriously vanished. Six months&#39; work down the drain. 

If you use this, be sure to back up your backup.
2363      I am unable to use this app to open Microsoft Works files on my iPhone five. I have to use WPS App to be able to read it. I wonder if this could be fixed.
1837      Just downloaded the app in my iPhone. Shows as downloaded. I hit open nothing opens. Get out of App Store and the downloaded app is nowhere to be found on my phone. How am I supposed to be able to redownload or do anything while I am unable to even try downloading again or see it on my phone...
3090      Why are they so many? It is freakin annoying update so regularly!
1961      Noooooo! :(
3108      For cloud storage, Dropbox is an excellent solution for me.  I don&#39;t usually save a whole lot of files to it, so the smaller, free account has been adequate so far, but when it comes to transferring files to other machines without a USB drive or accessing from my phone, Dropbox has been a very useful tool for me.
3294      Dropbox is a great program and tool, but with the last update which included a new PDF reader, I cannot open a PDF in full screen view, only thumbnail.  Please update, or if this is user problem, please inform.  I now have to use another program to vie my PDF files.
3395      Cannot paste into email field at login and cannot space to use keyboard shortcuts, eg my email address!  Argh!!!
Will take up in rating when this gets implemented.
2303      Now that I updated my drop box I am very upset 
Because I do not have an option to choose pictures to move to a folder 
Fix this problem and I will rate a 5 
Also I would like to export a whole folder to my gallery on my ipad
3138      Until the last update. Please fix.
2034      very beautiful:)
2824      Does anyone else have their Dropbox app, not the site, increasing in memory even without any favorite files???. Have to erase app once every 2 weeks!!!
2524      Major sync failure! You put documents at work and go home and sync again only to find none of them are there. Other times when they are actually synced you can&#39;t open them! I&#39;m deleting it.
1609      Since the update, it won&#39;t backup to Dropbox.
1814      Great option for storage!
2589      A great app. Please include editing support for ipad.
3485      I&#39;d really like it if that brought that back. Don&#39;t know why the took it out...(?)
1604      I love Dropbox and this app is pretty great.
2124      Im on a crappy hotel wifi that goes in and out. Been trying to download a 1gb file for over 2 days now. But for some reason dropbox has not allowed favorited downloads the ability to resume  and instead restarts the download from the beginning every time it fails. It&#39;s almost 2014. We have the technology to RESUME A DOWNLOAD what&#39;s the problem here?
2645      I cannot find the share button... It should be obvious but I can&#39;t find it. What&#39;s the point of this app if I can&#39;t share anything.
3526      Don&#39;t expect any product support with this software.

I am new to this sort of software, and I was concerned whether simply accessing photos several times each month would put me at risk of running over the monthly GB alloted by by phone carrier. They&#39;re downloaded from the Cloud, right? And anytime you download from the Cloud, you&#39;re transferring data, right? So it makes sense that, if you look at your pictures frequently, just accessing Dropbox on your iPhone will explode your data transfer byte usage.

I would have thought this a basic concern to anyone who has to pay a carrier for their cell phone usage; but (a) I couldn&#39;t find any documentation on this, (b) I couldn&#39;t even get an answer on the internet, which shocked me, and, most egregiously (c) I couldn&#39;t get a response from Dropbox itself, despite begging them multiple times for an answer to this simple question.

I&#39;m not about to use this product if it&#39;s going to send my phone bill through the roof, and I told Dropbox so. They couldn&#39;t care less. When you send them an email asking for help, they send you back an email saying, effectively, &#34;We&#39;re terribly busy, but if you really need help send a reply to this email.&#34; Well, don&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve tried it twice, and after weeks of waiting not a peep.

Incidently, I am also unable to access the Dropbox forums, despite having an account. When I try, I am told that my email address isn&#39;t verified -- this, despite the fact that they sent me a boilerplate email asking me why I wasn&#39;t using their product (isn&#39;t that a laugh). They have an automatic troubleshooter for this problem, but it doesn&#39;t work, either. If I could access the forums, I might be able to get a response to my concern there; but Dropbox wasn&#39;t interested in answering my separate email on this matter, either.

I say without malice that the support for this product is about as bad as I&#39;ve ever seen in nearly 30 years of working with computers. Don&#39;t expect any help with it from Dropbox. As soon as I can get an answer to this question about data transfer from one of their competitors, I&#39;ll be going with them.

Great product idea. Abysmal product support.
2767      Works great until you open a word document. The formatting on it is terrible. The tab and paragraphs are all messed up and overlapping. Hopefully this big I fixes soon. I love Dropbox other than that.
1933      I was able to use Dropbox with this update only once. After that, it just keeps &#34;Loading...&#34; and after a minute it crashes. I restarted my iPad but it didn&#39;t change anything. Please correct this!!!
2529      What about the I phone 4 updates? Ridiculous........
3030      Now we have bulk uploading of photos. But we can&#39;t download in batches/multiples? 

Hassle to download them one by one

PDF VIEWING ALSO NOT WORKING
1650      Needs a cloud sync feature. And subcategories.
1891      But why does location need to be enabled?
2671      Hi, I found a crazy bug on this app. IT WON&#39;T STOP TELLING ME TO OPEN ITUNES!!!
3510      Dropbox for iPhone and iPad both work exactly as expected.  Any document that I place in the Dropbox folder on the desktop of my MacBook is automatically and almost instantaneously, depending on the size of the file, synced to my iPhone 4S and third-generation iPad.  Third-party support with services such as CloudOn in particular makes iOS functionality even more excellent.  Dropbox is by far the best personal cloud file service out there, and I certainly recommend Dropbox over SkyDrive and Google Drive.  I have found both SkyDrive and Google Drive problematic and finicky, especially the Mac OS X application for Google Drive. Dropbox is always flawless, and this iPhone and iPad Dropbox application certainly illustrates this reliability.
2213      I uploaded all camera pics on my iPad when downloaded this app and I have found that there is no easy way to move the photos into folders so that I can only share pictures from a recent vacation.  I have iOS7.  Why is there no move function on this app or am I missing something????  I do not want to share one photo at a time.  Not impressed.
2109      Before no update the upload of picture was so fast but now after update it&#39;s so slow. For just 1 picture cannot upload. What happened?
2460      This App is great. The only issue is that in the IPad version I can&#39;t Rename my files. I have to Sign in in the Desktop version and rename my files.
2940      The app drains your battery cause it uses your gps all the time.
2708      When I open the app the little blue bubble pops up and says something about connecting to itunes to use push notifications and it won&#39;t go away.  I have tried reseting my ipad etc.  Nothing seems to work.  Really frustrating as this is the only app I have this issue with.  Any suggestions on how to fix?
2597      About time!! I always hating going into chrome or safari and sharing links. Great app. Definitely one of the best services out there.
3195      Since the last update, the app no longer opens on my iPad ??. Please fix this??. Thx
1950      Why is this for iOS 7 only now? Not very fair for people wanting to run this on older devices or don&#39;t wish to downgrade to cruddy iOS 7.
2979      Great app, just do not understand fact be using my location all day even with the application closed
2074      Great visual app!!!
2872      With drop box I am able to open office documents, making my iPad more useful!!! Not to mention using Dropbox on my iPad allows my iPad to have a file management system able to share documents with any computer/smartphone/tablet with out iTunes.
2726      Can&#39;t choose which files to NOT upload, so it just uploads everything from EVERY app (Vine videos? Really?) 
Please fix. 
Could be a winner of fixed.
2537      Since the latest update , Dropbox is not loading on my iPad.
1608      I don?t hate it. I can?t complete the download. I?ve tried several times on my iMac running Mavericks. I hope an update will solve the problem because Dropbox is great.
2724      Decent app but it&#39;s probably the slowest loading/performing app I have. Also occasionally just goes black for no reason and I have to restart. They need to quit updating every two or three days and actually take time to make a version that works properly
2986      This app needs the ability to search the files by title or by words and phrases in the documents. Also needs the ability to select and download multiple files at one time. Otherwise the app works well.
2283      Do not use dropbox with iOS7! It crashes my ipad (iPad 3) and doesn&#39;t let me open files. The top menu bar sports a hybrid iOS6/7 look on the left and right sides too, it&#39;s very strange. I hope they update it soon. I think you can get away with using the dropbox site through safari to get through this in the meantime. I had no problems with dropbox on iOS6.
2905      No customer service. No phone. Never reply to attempts to contact. Lost all my files. They say they keep an image for 30 days but good luck getting a hold of them. Deleting.
3275      Really nice app, very nice interface. Improved PDF viewer.
3050      Ability to delete photos from Dropbox while viewing individual photos instead of having to delete them from the multi viewer screen. So we can slide through photos and delete ones we don&#39;t want
2546      ????? ???? ?? ??????? ?? ????? ??? ???? ????? ???? ???? ????? ????       ????? ????? ??????? ????     ??????????
2401      I love the app, but I&#39;d love to have the option to rename folders and files.
2127      Current version is NOT compatible with updated Apple iPad OIS 7.
2259      Great companion to the service.
2781      I wait two months for Ukrainian translation, but still nothing! Hey, wake up!
3278      Just updated to the new version on iPhone 4 and now PDF viewer seems to be broken. Most PDFs display blank. I have found that opening a PDF, quitting DropBox, and then restarting sometimes helps. Please fix this!!!
2798      Needs the ability to link folders and not just files, though. Otherwise A+
3410      I&#39;ve never troubled myself to write a review before, but Dropbox deserves a great review!
3451      All of the sudden the audio streams in background again. Hope it continues to work. 

Back to five stars.
3083      Downloaded the latest update and now my app has disappeared, and the App Store won&#39;t let me download it again.
3037      If you want to store some apps in here will Dropbox let you store your apps on your IPhone into Dropbox or not? Say I have a lot of apps on my IPhone, can I store some of them in Dropbox?
2465      I really like this app but but for an app that is supposed to automatically sync this one has a big hole. I was using this to do some testing of an ePub file I found that syncing didn&#39;t work.

I selected the ebook and sent it to an app. So far so good. I found some errors which I fixed on my PC and reloaded the file on Dropbox. I then went back to Dropbox on my iPad and used the pull down which showed it to be my latest. I pushed the file to my test reader but it was still the old file!

My work around is to select some other file on Dropbox and then reselected the real file and pushed it again. This time it worked.

Hopefully this will get fixed.
3479      I gotta say, overall I like this app, although the logic behind the 15 min cap on streaming alludes me. I thought they may have imposed it to reduce bandwidth, but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth. The reason is because I start downloading the whole file, then start streaming it. Once the 15 min is up, I then switch to the downloaded file. To me, this uses more data. Why can&#39;t I just stream the whole thing? Overall, though, I like everything else about this app.
2548      Dropbox is fantastic! I always struggle to transfer pictures from my iPhone to computer and have lost pictures in the process. This is easy to use on all my devices! It&#39;s a lifesaver!
2025      Before the old the update everything was running fine. But now with the new update the pictures takes a long time to load. Very slow . Just fix it
1667      That moment I figured out I could transfer photos from my iPhone to laptop faster via dropbox than plugging my phone into the USB port.
2737      I am a fan. Easy to use. Fast transfer. What I like to see is a way to share a folder and not just a file. I would want to do this all here in the app and not go to the site anymore. If you do this, I&#39;d go for five stars. :)
3220      Eventho im reading about a bug in my case so far so good.
3027      I tried reloading but it still asks to connect to iTunes and will not work on my Ipad
2869      P?sima aplicaci?n. No habre ningun archivo
2857      WOW. It doesent let you upload videos it just starts to upload and then BAM it FREEZES!!!      So I can&#39;t upload any more SH/7.  PLZ FIX JUST FOR THAT IM GIVING IT 2Stars.   THE REST IS FINE.
1900      Where did the file viewer go?  I can&#39;t see the files anymore.  Excel is not showing up.
3379      Since the last update the app crashes and says there&#39;s a problem when I try to delete files. I love this app but it needs to be fixed-I use it all the time!
3421      Was a great app until ios6.  Now I can not prioritize uploads.  Very disappointing.
1795      I really love how Dropbox update design.
2790      Always thinking out in space without the upload number decreasing.  For days.  :(. Last successful upload was 3/31 and it&#39;s 4/20.
3158      Crashes on launch after the splash screen. Please fix!
2083      Cool app! and now sync to desktop app
1881      I like the new upgrade :) it looks very good. The only problem by now is that it is not sincronized the loading bar in the Favorites tab (when you download something on your tab) with that in Files tab, but overall 5 stars.
3482      Nice and smooth photo streaming from device to device
2209      One of the biggest problems I have is that the outline and search buttons seem to disappear after I use them once. After that I have to exit the file to use those buttons again because that&#39;s the only way to make the buttons re-appear.
2576      This is a useful tool
3112      Worked great before the last update, now it won t open.
3366      Good app
1846      Closes all the time
2783      How to add voice memo from the iPhone?!
2304      I generally love Dropbox, but since I upgraded to iOS 7 I can no longer view html files properly (I am referring to files saved on my Dropbox as .html). I used to view them displayed nicely as web pages, but now I just see the source code instead! Can you please fix that??

Also, can you please add the option to copy and move files? It would be a very useful feature!! Thanks!
2822      Used to work great but since the last update it&#39;s crashing and not opening simple PDF documents.

PLEASE FIX
2838      I
1772      The left hand menu/sidebar no longer minimizes so that you can expand the view of the document you are viewing - please fix!!!!
1770      Does what it claims &amp;amp; does it well. Really appreciate the UI.
3346      Latest update says they improved video streaming. What they did is now they convert video to crap quality and only let you stream 15 min. You have to fav them and have them saved on your device. Lame!
2094      This app was great until the update :(  Since the update, I can&#39;t view my files because of the push notification message popping up over and over. If this isn&#39;t fixed soon I will have to stop using Dropbox altogether. :(
2540      I wish it would stop telling me if I connect it to iTunes, I can get push notifications blah blah. It&#39;s annoying, I&#39;m hoping maybe an update will fix the pop up.
2426      Dropbox used to be among one of my favorite apps - fast, easy to use, and pretty. 

Now, I am no longer presented with the ability to upload photos one at a time from my ios photos albums, and must instead upload EVERY photo. I do not wish to share every photo with those I share folders with. 

 If this isn&#39;t what Dropbox intended with this update and/or I am actually at fault, they&#39;ve certainly made it more difficult to accomplish the task of uploading single photos at a time. Upon this update, I have been forced to switch to a different service.
2899      If i want to enable background camera upload, it asks for the location. I do not use my cellular network for camera upload. So the only option is the WiFi.

Why would an app asks for location if it only uses the wifi. Just check if it is connected to a wifi access point or not?

Other than that, the app is great, fast and easy to use. But the major reason for me to use the dropbox mobile app is camera upload. So, three stars till this location thing changes.

Keep coding!
3139      You should put the folders first... And then the files!
I would put a folder as favorite, thus putting all the files inside this as favorite too.
2345      Not sure how I lived without it. Best way I know to keep all my important files in one place so I can access them from anywhere on any device!
2254      Can&#39;t see my files. Guessing it&#39;d bc this doesn&#39;t support ios 7. Please update!!!
1893      Well, it seems that this app will no longer work with any IOS prior to IOS7.  I can&#39;t even get it to load on my iPhone.  Is there some way to go back to a previous version and use that?
3398      Es una de las mejores aplicaciones que existe en general, su belleza y simplicidad hacen que el usuario no se complique mas... Yo ya ni USB uso, prefiero tener todo en internet y accesible desde cualquier dispositivo o cualquier parte del mundo sin depender de nada mas que acceso a internet...

100% o mejor dicho 1000% recomendada!!!
Me ha salvado muchas veces la vida...
3413      This app is useless it doesn&#39;t let me load anything !!!!! :(
2193      Videos dont work with ios 7, update please
1844      I like the new app! It looks very clean and smooth. It runs great and my files open very quickly! Some people are just complaining about the new icon just to jump on the bandwagon...get
Over yourselves ...
2580      ?? It should&#39;ve had way to disable the photo tab, (Tab #2) So it wouldn&#39;t be showing EVERY PHOTO You have in Dropbox. It show every photo, Regardless of what folder it&#39;s in
3213      After the update the app will not even open on my iPad.  Otherwise Dropbox is the best.
3502      In word documents, headers and footer are not well placed as well as tables don&#39;t appear ... In excel too.. Cells are not separated and conditional formatting doesn&#39;t appear... Please help and fix it.. I need it urgently in my work
Thanks in advance.. :D
2319      Music takes 15 seconds to load after you have selected a song ( doesn&#39;t matter if I&#39;m on Verizon LTE or Wifi) also, it doesn&#39;t play the next song automatically instead you have to open the app, go back and pick the next song in the folder. You can&#39;t even hit the &#34;next&#34; button to skip tracks.  Please fix these in the next update!

Running iOS7. Same issues on iOS 6
2517      Kindly add rename function for folders and fils. Just simply by adding extra option icon where we slide for more actions.
Keep up the great job.
Cheers
2071      After last update for iOS it stopped working properly. A lot of issues!
2644      It works well for very small files. Takes forever to load medium sized to large files. A simple pdf can&#39;t even load! Inconvenient. You have to fix this.
2804      I love being able to have access anytime to my Dropbox files! If only I could edit my excel files! Still the best out there!
2152      If you have a lifetime to wait for files to download and transfer to your camera role this may be the app for you.  It&#39;s much faster to take the time to sync your iPad 2 and transfer your files through iTunes.  I&#39;m disgusted!
1659      great apps!! i use it every time i want to share file to all my friend!!
2894      Would love to be able to print right from the app instead of having to go through the browser or open it in another app. Otherwise very convenient.
2573      I wish it had basic photo editing features like cropping since any image cropped by iPhone, will upload w/o the cropping.
2159      Sometime in the last month Dropbox stopped syncing. The most recent files on my phone are all 1 month old yet there are many more current files that I have loaded in Dropbox desktop folder for syncing. Help!
2690      New update doesn&#39;t detail what&#39;s changed. Now the app doesn&#39;t work. Just a black screen with a gray bar at the bottom. Please fix soon.
3393      Dropbox....always the best!!!
1674      App is ok for accessing files.  I really want to be able to edit documents and attach docs to emails like one can do on a computer.  Also, any chance that the ability to open and read .zip files could be added.
3337      I love Dropbox because its a perfect tool for keeping your files with you whenever. 
I just wish that photos wouldn&#39;t show as a list and you could change it so you see all your photos as a grid, much like the photo library on the iPhone.
1913      I want the old version , this don&#39;t have the option to share my files via Facebook message ,please bring back the previous version or fix that !!!!
1855      it&#39;s horrible , it&#39;s slow !!!
3207      Since last update unable to use app, just get splash screen and then it crashes and closes. Hope fix in on the way soon. Also before adding new features lets clean up the interface and stop classifying videos as photos. Ever since the new interface it&#39;s taken more steps to find and upload my videos.
1793      I am a big fan of DropBox in general but the recent upgrade for the iPad version cannot view excel files... which is an obvious and very basic problem to miss.  My other complaint is that you can no longer adjust the size of a photo when uploading.  As the camera resolution increases, so does the need for more storage since DropBox only allows photos to be uploaded in their original, full size.
2003      But still no iWork support when viewing Pages and Numbers documents?
2444      The open with option doesn&#39;t work for encrypted documents since the has a built in document reader that can&#39;t edit files.  Please add an &#34;open with&#34; option to use before viewing the file so a document editor can be used to modify it and then save it right back to Dropbox.
1648      Great App. Need alerts and then 5 stars
2321      You guys seriously need to have the tool to rename a file and copy a file. It is driving me insane!!!!!!! ??
3033      This app is really useful for having access to documents while I&#39;m out.  The one big thing I think it lacks is a way to share folders while you&#39;re using the app.  I&#39;d love to be able to share a folder via the app and I&#39;ve needed to so this before while I was out, but unfortunately, this app as of 3/1/13 doesn&#39;t have that feature.  It would be really useful to have!
2878      This app is good. I like evrything except you cannot able to upload back the videos to the camera rolls to free some space. Please fix it!!!! Thanks
1778      I love it but I mainly want to extract my files and I don&#39;t know how if u can PLZ tell if not PLZ update for extract! ^_^
2762      I&#39;ve never had an issue with Dropbox before,so I don&#39;t know what all these people are complaining about.its a great app that has truly streamlined my life with its convenience. HOWEVER,after updating it the other day to a newer version,it is CONSTANTLY transmitting location data and WILL NOT SHUT OFF.i know i can simply turn off the location services for this app under &#34;settings&#34;,but I SHOULDN&#39;T HAVE TO.its worked fine with them turned on for years,and i shouldn&#39;t have to change MY settings just for a faulty program.this is very annoying,and I hope someone will please fix this as soon as possible.
3367      Best app ever
2915      I&#39;d love to be able to share folders and create custom links from inside the app. Currently I have to do it by logging in my account in safari.

Other than that, the app is perfect. DropBox easily exceeds other options of cloud service (except for free space offered).
1751      Looks nice, but for some reason I can&#39;t open some files in Pages and Numbers. The &#34;Open In&#34; option is available in some iWorks documents, but not all. There doesn&#39;t seem to be any consistency about which files can be opened.
2352      Very good program
2368      can u add a multiple transfer photos  &#34;drop box to phone&#34; .,cause it hard to save or copy one by one
2316      I love this app, BUT it is not working with iOS7!!!!!

Please help Dropbox.
1955      I love Dropbox! I also love the new look. I do wish there was a way to view the full file names of files and edit file names. There is a reason that Windows went away from 8.3.
1890      This update makes it harder and slower to use. The icons for different file types all look very similar, which makes it slower to scan through and find the desired file. The old version used colors, which made it much faster to use.
2960      I use this app for all my classes. Having access to textbooks and slides via PDF  is key in college!
2841      What happened to &#34;open in&#34; option? I need to be able to view Dropbox items in other apps. Why the heck would you guys disable your most useful feature???
1883      Can&#39;t access my files with the recent update the app just closes.
2614      I think this app is awesome and this whole program altogether! But I mostly use Dropbox for music and it gets kind of annoying that the music doesn&#39;t go in a playlist like in the music app. Can you change that?
1820      What&#39;s with all the white? This isn&#39;t the settings app, give it a little life!
2579      The App is good but needs a few improvements.

1.  Allow users to rename files.

2.  Allow users to select multiple files to save to camera roll
2068      Works well, especially for saving files for offline use.
3168      Previous version was fine. Latest version now can no longer be opened on iPad mini. It crashes as soon as I open it.
2489      Open the app
3498      I&#39;m not sure how I got along prior to Dropbox.  I use it for sharing and collaboration with my coworkers, my dealer force and my dad and brother on the farm.  It is so simple to use.  This is a no-brainer!!
3538      Good app but ever since the last update I can no longer open PDFs from using DropBox. The option is there but pressing open in Dropbox doesn&#39;t do anything.
1750      This app is really neat. visually pleasing. and the new task by voice on this thing is really work. most of the times. good job!!
1889      The new UI is beautiful and functional. However, it&#39;s still missing some important management features such as renaming, or using file versions.
1863      I have some videos on my phone and they take too much space; I&#39;ve wanted to put them into Dropbox so I can get that space back. It&#39;s taking forever though. I took those videos last year and the first one is still downloading. Please fix it!!!
3010      It is annoying that it adds all your pictures without warning (I take a lot of useless photos that I end up deleting but it&#39;s still in the cloud and having to redelete them in annoying). But, I hate carrying around a USB and tend to loose them and this us better than emailing it. All my docs are synced so I can get to it on my iPod touch, my laptop, and the schools iMac after I used the site to sign into my account. I wanted to do this with iCloud but I&#39;m out if memory cause of mail! Why do I did to back my mail up its Soo stupid! I don&#39;t have pages and won&#39;t pay for that so iCloud is useless to me!
2093      The app was working perfectly and I loved it. But I don&#39;t know why it stopped working!  It says that I had downloaded it but when I tried to open it it doesn&#39;t work!! Please fix it !!
3097      Great app! Simple to use; keeps important doc&#39;s handy and portable wherever you are. Easy to organize. Great for simple file storage and organization.
3155      As soon as i updated to version 2.1. I can&#39;t open Dropbox. I can&#39;t delete it--but it is not on my phone. And I can&#39;t redownload it....help!

Updated: I see the suggestion is to delete and reinstall--HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DELETE WHAT ISN&#39;T ON THE PHONE, despite the fact that the App Store says to open the app, but will NOT open when you press the button?

FURTHER UPDATE--version 2.1.1 brought back dropbox to my phone. Upgraded to 3 stars. Once I play with it, I will assess whether it deserves more stars...
2260      All my pictures and files from my ipad are now saved on to Dropbox and I don&#39;t have to worry that I&#39;ll ever lose them. This app is a must.
1588      I will not be updating Dropbox on my other devices because I refuse to update to the hideous ios7 or ios7 &#34;look and feel&#34; apps. Did Johny Ive really think that replacing all of the grays and blacks in an OS he thought was too dark wouldn&#39;t go too far in the other direction? Similarly every single app that gets updated to a &#34;beautiful&#34; ios7 look is one I will not update. The only exception to this is Steam which looks great still.

So, the version I use gets 4 stars with only minor hiccups. The new version looks awful and only runs on an awful looking OS. I&#39;ll pass, thanks.
1749      $W@G
2840      Argh. Crashes all the time. This service, and this app, would be great if the app didn&#39;t crash when reading PDFs.

Great when it works.
3328      The app is like a 2nd photo stream that stores than pics.  The 15 limit on watching my videos becomes a bit of an issue. In order for me to watch the MY videos I must favorite it?! I have issue with that but otherwise it&#39;s a cool app.
2994      Dropbox is great, although i wish this app had a better way to listen to music! If you could actually move from one song to the next automatically, that would be great. Or be able to browse the app while listening to music on your dropbox
2829      I found the app very handy..should add on the features end
2652      Quits immediately I see the main screen! A bug definitely. I use iPad 4, 32gb wifi+4g, latest iOS. I&#39;m on the fast WiFi right now.
2820      It allows me to share individual photos but not entire folders!  What good is that?? I can easily text someone a single photo ... WTH ?  I want to be able to send a link to people of an entire folder with many pics in it from my mobile.  Seems useless now. 

On the other hand I do like that I can view and share excel documents. That&#39;s pretty cool. Although it does take quite a while to load it seems.
1712      It&#39;s very convenient to use, however not being able to switch between accounts without un-linking the phone would be great. Also an improvement in the media player would also help.
1828      Really annoying when you are reviewing a document and you change orientation and the document reloads and takes you back to the beginning every time. Also does it if you leave the app to do something and then go back to the document. A user friendly app would hold the place of whatever you are reviewing. It gets old, real fast, scrolling through a 50+ page document, multiple times.
3002      I was shocked to find out today that users have been asking for the ability to view long untruncated long filenames for 2 YEARS.  

Why can I view a long filename on the iPhone app yet NOT on the iPad app?  This is just silly.  Please, dropbox business managers and developers; demonstrate that you listen to reasonable requests for sensible GUI improvements and FIX THIS. 

Also,  I cannot believe that it is not possible to sort files by upload date or some other field.  As far as I can see the files are always listed alphabetically. 

I am a programmer so I know these are relatively easy fixes to implement.  It is mind bending as to why such glaring deficiencies in an otherwise awesome platform are not corrected.  For this reason that I have given a 2 star rating.
1786      This app is great but the only thing I don&#39;t like is that that it freezes a lot and doesn&#39;t load all of my pictures
1776      Dropbox went from the best app to the worst. With the iWorks update I can no longer open my iWorks docs, rendering Dropbox totally useless. Please restore the functionality we count on. Then I cave give you the 5 star rating you deserve.
3363      Great app but you should add the option of change folder and files names
3432      I use DropBox frequently until the latest upgrade. The DropBox app no longer communicates with DropBox on my iMac.
2655      Since the last update, Dropbox says I have no installed apps to open PDF files when I actually do. I am unable to open them in Adobe Reader or ifile.
1562      Ever since iOS 7 update, Dropbox has not worked; constantly crashes, when it does run it is EXTREMELY slow, and there are problems with camera uploading. PLEASE FIX ASAP.
2311      No but really good design, works very smoothly and shows many potentials of growth. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I really loved it.
1602      I save important documents on my Dropbox and after these last two updates I can&#39;t access them. I&#39;m really disappointed with the IOS 7 version of this app
3257      I&#39;m running iOS 6.1.1 on a iPhone 4S -- just updated the app and it keeps crashing upon opening. Please fix.
1727      My videos aren&#39;t loading into my Dropbox. Once the load all the way up, and should go in and move on to the the next instead it jus starts over. Can you please help? Otherwise it&#39;s great. Thanks for fixing the uploading vids bak into phone problem.
2243      Everything is like you have to buy to fully enjoy
3467      The latest update freezes on Apple 4 phone.
3122      Thank you for your great work Dropbox!!
3019      Was not able to gett it to work for me -- computer???? and ipad [ok].

wish thre were better directions. I will keep looking for an app that I can inderstand. Sorry.
3101      The last update fixed nothing. Still can&#39;t view 90% or my PDFs.

Deleting and reinstalling the app did fix it though.
2326      I (and many other Dropbox users) have been waiting months for DB to fix the Dropbox/iPad file browser bug that only shows the first few characters in the filename. Why can&#39;t they repair this? It works great in iPhone (landscape mode) which has much less screen real estate, but not iPad. 

Now I have to just guess when transferring files with similar long filenames to my iPad. Such a simple problem, but ignored by developers (after many requests by users!)

Other than this glaring error, a great product.
2053      Just because it is all white doesn&#39;t make it &#34;beautiful.&#34; I liked the look of the old app more. Beware of update.
1735      Can&#39;t upload anything but photos. No memos. No text.
2010      Se nota que es m?s fluida.
Me gustar?a que los dem?s aprendieran hacer asi sus apps, ya que ios7 ha ralentizado mucho mis igadgets.
Se agradece la velocidad.
2482      Dropbox is good but it takes too long to upload videos
2923      I use this app every day for school. It&#39;s reliable and super handy.
1809      Title says it all.
1977      New features and functionality are great, but the updated iOS 7 interface is horrible. I have no idea why all these UI designers think having everything the same color (white!) is better. It&#39;s not. Flat style is fine, but apps need visible separation between content and control functions. Old UI was much better in this regard.
1639      Can&#39;t open files, files won&#39;t update.  They show they haven&#39;t been modified in months when I modified it five minutes ago and all my other devices and computers not on iOS7 show the update.  If these problems get fixed I&#39;ll change my rating until then it will remain a 1 star.
3201      The latest update broke the application.  Before the update 5 stars after the update 1 star.  Please fix.  iPhone 4S 6.1
3236      Cant get my files. It will not open. Please fix.
3486      Mine has been stuck in the update mode for 3 days now
1759      I used to be able to view .xls files on my iPad AND iPhone.  I can still view them on my iPhone but they no longer open on the iPad. 

Sometimes the files will open for a few seconds and then a gray screen comes up. Most of the time I just get the gray screen.  The gray screen has the file name, &#34;Office Open XML Spreadsheet&#34;&#39; and the file size.

My spreadsheets are simple (no macros) and small in size.  I&#39;ve tried creating new spreadsheets and have the same issue.  Web research shows others have same issue but no fixes have worked for me. 

I&#39;m on the latest IOS 7.0.4 and the most recent version of Dropbox 3.0.1.

Chat with Apple Support says it is a DropBox issue.
1905      It keeps crashing every time I open the app????
2670      app used to work wonderful except recent update.. unable to open most of our PDF files .. DROPBOX help!!! need fix ASAP!!
2709      The app greatly enhances the capability of the iPad by making it truly portable.  You are able to access your materials on all of your devices &amp; share with others either for the purpose of collaboration or simply dispersing information.  Both are very useful in the world of education!
2594      I have never written a review about any app thus far. Just yesterday, I was thinking about how incredibly useful Dropbox is. I had decided to write a review and give Dropbox 4 stars. However with the implementation of the ability to share links to files and folders in the most recent update, Dropbox has my 5 stars!!!
2606      I don&#39;t really know how to created the file like a word document or something.
1907      Still very easy to share files, but why lose the in-app control for AirPlay? Not a huge deal, but I liked the old version better.
3048      Great for sending and sharing large files. Wish they&#39;d allow you to send and share the folders and files from the app.
2801      There are many ways to transfer photos between devises so I don&#39;t know what good is one more app to do that! I thought that this would be good enough to transfer acrobat reader o PDF files -NOT!!
2909      This would easily be a 5 star app. Best idea ever.  But it loses 2 stars just because I have to download one photo at a time. This is a huge inconvenience.
2285      None of the files will open after update of iOS 7.
1845      Can&#39;t open numbers files
2022      Beautiful app!! Thanks Dropbox for keeping my porn safe. HAHAHAH jk!
2141      It says I&#39;ve downloaded the app but it won&#39;t let me open it from the App Store. The icon isn&#39;t even on my phone!! Please fix for iOS 7!!
3268      Since the update, I can no longer open pdf files. That makes this once-essential app virtually useless to me.
1654      I LOVE Dropbox. In fact, my iPad would be useless without it. I need THAT much space. My only issue is that it still is taking FOREVER to upload videos I recorded. Like over an hour. Once it even got 65% of the way there, but then 15 mins later, it said &#34;couldn&#39;t connect to Dropbox.&#34; And all the time that it is uploading I have to keep tapping to keep my iPad awake (because there is no &#34;Do Not Go To Sleep&#34; setting for this app) AND you have to keep it in Dropbox because it cannot upload in the background. I do not blame Dropbox for this, because it easily uploads in the background on my Droid. I love this app, just wish it had a few more setting options or resolved the uploading video issue.
3100      Useless for mobile users. Can&#39;t get a share link without first downloading the actual file to your mobile device over your cellar connection.
2384      I&#39;ve been a user and fan of Dropbox for two years.  Wonderful service for MacBook Air with SSD memory.  The iPad app now continuously crashes - usually when opened or a few seconds later.  Using an iPad mini with latest operating system and 64GB memory.  I hope they patch this issue quickly.  

RC
2021      The app&#39;s new look is aesthetically elegant.
2944      I noticed that location service is on all the time next to my battery indicator. Stopping the app and resetting my phone didn&#39;t help. Ended up turning it off under privacy settings. It was eating up my battery with location services stuck on. Please fix!
2189      Need to be able to search and find words or phrases, electronically! Digitally! Not by having to open and tediously read doc after doc, file after file, to find what I need. Please create a search function that works within and among files.
2284      I use Dropbox all the time. It&#39;s great. 

Please don&#39;t disable the auto fill in email sign in tho. I need to switch frequently between work and personal accounts. Typing my full email in without my auto-fill is a massive pain. 
Thanks

UPDATE: autocomplete seems to be working now. I guess my device was being quirky. Updating to 5 stars!
2539      Fix gifs and you get 5 starts.
2810      Not working crash when open. IOS:6.1.2
1617      Just that one word, wow!!!!
2462      The last update deleted all my saved videos!!! I have no way to recover them and they were very important to me.
1571      Flat out will not open on a new iPad Air
2138      Ever since IOS 7, it has been crashing. 
Can we expect a fix?
2813      can&#39;t share a folder
can&#39;t accept a shared folder
can&#39;t download or upload anything but photos

i just use a file management app that integrates with DropBox, such as Files Pro
1921      I should have read the reviews first!!!  I can&#39;t stand the all white...agree with one of the other reviews...I don&#39;t want to open it up!
3358      I can&#39;t get a shared folder through the app b/c I need to click on a verification email which I never received. What&#39;s the purpose of a password to open the app, then?
1702      What is the point of having the option of background upload... When it doesn&#39;t upload in the background? I would love for it to backup my photos and what not while I&#39;m asleep and on wifi and charging... But instead I have to make sure the app is running...
1742      The video I&#39;m trying to upload is taking very long
2718      Update from several days ago is still trying to install. Looks like I will have to remove and reinstall app.
2400      This app is great. Dropbox is always very reliable for me.
2764      The last upgrade just got stuck 1/3rd through the download, so I can&#39;t eve use this anymore! Disappointed.
2111      ...But please add the ability to only sync photos. Currently you can only set it to sync photos AND videos. 

Videos are just too large to be worth syncing.
2653      ??????????????
3513      The app that I use the most
2683      woh woh woh
getting worse buddy
make a change i know you&#39;re mind opens but your app really don&#39;t
3541      I would like the ability to share a complete folder not just one file at a time. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m just not seeing this feature? It seems like a basic function at this point, since you can do basically everything else within the app platform. Other than that, I am very happy with the experience.
2347      I wish that the app would send push notifications when new files have been added just like a desktop computer would notify you. I also wish that you could invite other to folders from the app versus just sharing a link with them ...

Other than that, I love Dropbox!
2918      The app will not let me apply downloads to minecraft pe
1757      Ok
3478      The update rendered dropbox useless to me. I export audio from my lectures to mp4 from Microsoft word. It used to play flawlessly on my iPhone using dropbox app. Now it says &#34;unable to load photo.&#34; This is really really annoying. Ill change my star when this gets fixed. Why update something that worked fine before?
3233      I have used this app for a long time and it has always worked well. Annoying glitch though- Dropbox has stopped translating date code in Excel spreadsheet. Did up to six months ago- now only displays the code (not the actual date) in my spreadsheets and I really need to see the dates. Other than that, app performs well.
2649      Please fix the crashes , bugs and if its possible ,make the App faster
1892      A+++++
2743      Awesome
1598      The app continues to freeze at 32 pictures. I have deleted and reinstalled it, and it still continues to do the same. When I close the app and reopen it, it freezes completely and will not let me access anything. I have not reached my maximum storage either.
2619      Can&#39;t rename or edit files
1836      It crashes every time I try to open the app
1612      This is a terrific ( and terrifically priced) app!!!
1701      My iPad air and iPhone 4 on iOS 7 still will not open any pages documents, all they show is the document name and size
3144      I can&#39;t open my dropbox app on my iPad 4! Please FIX this issue Asap!
3082      Newest update lost many of my documents and other I can no longer open. Please fix!
2091      Keeps docs &amp; pics synced between my desktop, laptop &amp; cell phone. I use it EVERYDAY! It&#39;s a must have app
2624      I love this app is super useful. I would love it even more if you could send documents by email and not by generating a link. sending the email with an attachment. 
Love it :)
2132      I just got my new 5s. Used to work with 4s very well but the weird thing is I could never download it on my new 5s!! It just says &#34;open&#34;, how could I open without even download?
2812      After I entering my ID and pass, when I do log in button, the app crashes no matter what I try.  Help...?
1584      Won&#39;t download
2502      I would really like to be able to rename files and folders. It would help out a lot.
2961      When you need some way to store electronic debate information... This app is a perfect way to do so
1971      White white white!
2823      Why can&#39;t I open my folders without getting online from my IPad ?  What&#39;s a pass code ? I did not gave any codes when I installed the app in my iPad.

Thank you
1615      Dropbox is extremely  useful. Easy to access on any device or on their website. I&#39;ve never had any issues with it and have been a user for years.
3464      Even when connected via wifi, uploading 10 photos took over an hour, synced via Mac sync to dropbox took less than a minute.
2959      whenever i establish a relationship with a vendor who requires an email address from me, i give them an email address unique to just them.  i give that email address to no-one else and, in most circumstances, i will never send an email _from_ that email address.  

that is exactly what i did with dropbox.

i signed up for a dropbox account almost a year ago, on march 21, 2012.  i immediately received the standard &#34;welcome&#34; email.  over the course of the next nine months i received exactly three additional marketing-type emails from them.

then i started getting spam/phishing emails.  on 19-feb-2013 i received an email saying my direct deposit had been disallowed; on 26-feb-2013 i received an email indicating new security was being put in place for ACH and EFT transactions; and on both 27-feb and 28-feb-2013 i received an email asking me to join a linkedin account.  all four emails were phishing emails.

since i have never shared that email address with anyone, since i had never sent any email _from_ that address, and since the emails were all phishing emails, then one of three things has happened:

- dropbox sold, gave away, or otherwise shared my information with one or more dubious with parties.

- someone hacked dropbox&#39;s systems and stole my information.

- dropbox has one or more rogue employees who is using customer information for their own benefit.

i used dropbox&#39;s web form to contact two different departments about the security breach, and i also sent two email messages about the security breach from the email address i had given them but to date i haven&#39;t heard a single thing.  

dropbox has a legal obligation to inform all impacted customers about any security breach.  a security breach is what happened here and they are nowhere near fulfilling that obligation.
2660      To clear cache, you have to unlink your account and re-link it. Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to make a &#34;clear cache&#34; button?!

Also, there seems to be a bug now where entering my PIN kinda freezes up the app. Weird?

Fix please! =)
2017      Keeps crashing!! Need a fix fast!!!!
1992      HOW CAN I CAN MAXIMIZE THE SLIDE SHOW ?! IT DISAPPEARED .. BAD UPDATE
1922      Population: Dropbox
2928      Not sure why people are complaining. Clearly Dropbox limits its features due to the Apple developer license agreement. If they wanted more indepth file system features it would have been added. Don&#39;t blame Dropbox.
1569      Seriously? I can&#39;t do anything. The app won&#39;t load. It just keeps foreclosing. What a shame.
2712      Love dropbox, but it looks like the last update has messed up the location service. My location icon is constantly on now and when I look in Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Location, Dropbox is the only app showing it accessed this function.
3058      :)
3445      just got an ipad 3. from the app how do i share a folder? working in landscape the keyboard obscures the form for adding an email recipient. Portrait I can&#39;t see the whole screen. So then I go to to safari and the dropbox website -- total jumbled mess. Now I will wait to go home to my desktop to add a share of a folder. not impressed.
3317      The best app ever!
2348      Dropbox is a great platform ? until you have a problem.  I&#39;ve been a premium paying customer for over a year -- not because I needed the extra space, but because I&#39;ve used it as my backup and sharing platform for a major project.  Last month I had a problem where the app was using up all available CPU on my mac.  Emailed support, and they gave me various random solutions to try which required repeatedly syncing all 5 gig of files and losing all the &#39;last modified&#39; info which is essential for version control.  After 3 random &#34;try this&#34; tech solutions they simply stopped responding to emails, and never provided any other recourse or even answered my question whether phone support was available -- a question I asked them 5 times.

Useful for file sharing a la Yousendit but DO NOT ENTRUST DROPBOX WITH IMPORTANT FILES!!!!
3315      The app keeps getting better and faster with each update, but GIF support is nowhere to be seen. It&#39;s kind of pathetic that iOS Messages supports animated GIF and this app does not.

PS. Could the new icon be any lamer?
2398      It does not show your stuff at times. I&#39;d open it and say I click on a folder that has files in it and I wouldn&#39;t find anything. I know they are there. It&#39;s great except for this problem.
3096      Latest version won&#39;t even update. :-(
3113      After last update I had to uninstall. It crashes my iPhone5. This was a great app until this update. PLEASE FIX!! I miss it.
2926      The app in iPhone needs important issue &#34;share via email&#34;
3119      How can I contact Dropbox to let them no that the app no longer opens on my iPad? 
Tom James
1583      I like it a lot
2033      La aplicacion se cierra nomas al empezarla.
1707      In a previous version, if the user was looking at pictures and suspended the app it would leave it right where they were upon restarting the app. Now the app completely refreshes at start up, which gets annoying sometimes. Also its more cumbersome to swipe through images since it&#39;s only responsive on the top half of the screen instead of the whole screen.
1842      Works ok on my 2 laptops and IPhone.  Won&#39;t fully load on IPad 1st Gen shows 3/4 loaded and stops.
3535      Please improve your photo viewing experience and provide full screen option to see photos, videos and documents.
1959      This app is why I prefer Dropbox to Google drive.
3472      I love this app and think it&#39;s great but with one of the latest updates I seem to be having some issues with previously downloaded video playbacks? I use guitar practice mini-videos and in the past the videos I saved as my favorites played instantaneously but now, every now and then I have to re-download them all over again? 

I want to keep them in my Dropbox because I use the mini-videos for guitar practice while overseas where often I have no or limited wi-fi (don&#39;t use network as it&#39;s very expensive to roam overseas). Not sure why I have to re-download those videos every now and then?  Often they&#39;ll work fine for weeks at a time and then all of a sudden I have to download them again?  Otherwise it&#39;s a great app and this is just a small glitch.
2149      App crashes by having dialog repeat &#34;Connect to iTunes to enable Push Notifications&#34;. Had to delete, breaks app switching and breaks main menu button
2837      I use Dropbox every day. This app is how I backup my notes, transfer them between all my devices, and access them to study. My issue is that all my notes are large PDFs. For some reason, when I load a file, the file seems to get stored in the app data for dropbox. And it seems like more than that gets stored in there because after a while I end up with a dropbox app taking up 1+GB of space on my iPad. This is difficult because I have a 16GB iPad and have lots of other apps on here for studying and need to conserve space. The only way I have found to clear this memory is to uninstall the app every time it balloons, which, as you can probably guess, is extremely annoying. If someone can tell me an easier way to clear this space or if Dropbox can fix this issue, this would be a five star app for me.
3470      I had two .mov files that I marked as favorite, thinking that they would be available offline. Tried to play them later only to be greeted with &#34;file not available, no Internet connection.&#34;

Conveniently, dropbox let&#39;s me upload my files over to Google Drive. Done. Offline capabilities on Google Drive are actually real. Goodbye dropbox, have fun competing with google.
3199      why does everything constantly have to be updated?? There was nothing wrong with Dropbox. The &#34;enhanced&#34; PDF-viewer isn&#39;t working on my Ipad
2123      It helped me alot thanks
2176      Dropbox has been my go to for everything ever since 2009. But this update has ruined everything. I run out of space and my phone frequently and all I do it upload everything to dropbox and clear my space up. But I have been trying to upload my 500 pictures for about 4 days now,when it usually only takes less than an hour. And I&#39;ve been stuck on 25 pics for about 2 of these days. I have my internet connected and then nothing will upload. This really needs to my fixed.
3174      After the last update, dropbox crashes every time safari attempts to open anything with it... Haven&#39;t tried with other apps, but this is a major problem with me since I&#39;ve been using the two together, also it now will not open the last few .jpgs I&#39;ve created on my Mac...
2819      This is the best most helpful app I have ever used. I am newer to the iPhone. Converted from the blackberry and I was nervous I wouldn&#39;t like it, but this app alone has confirmed how great it is to have an iPhone / iPad and it even sync with my personal laptop. It makes my life so much easier. Saving documents and being able to send them to email, share and even open in iCloud and edit. Love it!!!! Get it!
2617      Finally we can share links to folders!
1953      With the new update I cannot upload a video!! I already went through all the settings and cant find out why it is not uploading, and it doesnt let me cancel either.
1724      This is going to save me so much time!
2245      I can&#39;t live without my Dropbox!
2970      According to your upload meter I upload a picture repeatedly until I either force close the app or take a new photo and then it uploads that continuously. 

Worse than that, when I try uploading a file from my phone it gets stuck behind the never ending queue. Come on Dropbox, you screwed the pooch on this. Prioritize uploads as manual uploads top priority and camera uploads as last priority. 

I&#39;m grateful for Dropbox and what they have given us...but now if it doesn&#39;t work it doesn&#39;t matter if it was free or not.
2747      Best PDF reader I&#39;ve used on iOS. I mean, much better than safari or iBooks. Haven&#39;t tried very many I guess
1839      .... But lately the app doesn&#39;t let me open pdf files. I hope that gets fixed soon.
2515      Need to be able to share folders.
2251      I love our Dropbox functionality and speed. BUT the iPad app is broken. I am not finding a way to read the longer, truncated file names in the left column. I can only hide it, not adjust it.  This is no biggie for people with short names but our company has some longer descriptives in the names. Please fix so we can resize the column boundaries, as with many other apps.
3154      I love everything in Dropbox. It keeps your pictures and videos safe and keeps all of your stuff in there safe.
3146      I&#39;m not sure why anyone would rate this app less than five stars. It is a must-have application for all iPhones.
3020      Provide the rudimentary ability to create editable text documents and you&#39;ll take a giant leap forward. The idea you don&#39;t have this simple feature is very strange. While you don&#39;t need the full feature set provided by Evernote, you should at least allow the ability to create and edit text documents.

C&#39;mon, seriously.
3480      I use this to share documents between all of my devices (iPhone, iPad, MacBook, PC Laptop etc... It does exactly what I need it to.
3325      This is a bad update, if you have not updated, don&#39;t!

With the latest version Dropbox has removed the ability to save favorited video files locally and play them. So for example that episode of downton abbey or glee that you put in Dropbox, and then favorited on your iPad will not be viewable

Instead the geniuses in San Francisco let you stream 15 minutes off their network servers. hey guys, why do you think I favorited the video? I want to watch it all,but I can&#39;t

Bad update, from a company that used to do so well. It all went downhill when Adam left.
2676      The last update deleted everything I had. I had a lot of stuff. How do we get it all back?
1714      hello I&#39;ve Ben using this app for a while now and I got the iPhone 5s and it keeps on crashing on me and having trouble? please help me
2715      Very useful to save files. Love that I can view PDF&#39;s in mi iPod touch without having wifi. I have my information whenever I go. Great for school!
2232      Since the iOS 7 update the app is useless.  I have been using the app for sharing files while I travel but it know longer works. 
Is there going to be a fix or do I just start deleting it off all my devices?  On the iPad it just crashes.
3156      Realmente la mejor App que puede existir en lo que a manejo y respaldo de archivos se refiere, toda aquella aplicaci?n que no tenga compatibilidad con Dropbox ya no es ?til o simplemente se descarta, gracias a esta Aplicaci?n me olvido de pasar las fotos de mi iPhone o iPad a la Pc ya que se hace autom?ticamente, me despreocupo por andar (como antes lo hac?a) con un Pen drive con la informaci?n del trabajo o archivos de importancia, todo se resuelve con mis dispositivos o en cualquier PC con internet, y si por seguridad de acceso se trata tambi?n es muy segura, felicito a sus programadores y dise?adores por tan valiosa App, si me dieran a elegir para quedarme con tan s?lo una App sin dudarlo ser?a Dropbox...
1662      A new, fun, and interactive approach to to-do lists.
1906      Since they did a new update almost all my JPEG take too much time to open or even don&#39;t open. I need to save the file to see the photo on my iPhone. 

How can I have the old version?????
2765      Problems with geolocation !!!
3104      What is taking so long to fix the crashing?  This used to be a great app.  So upset!
1578      All these updates, and I still can&#39;t rename things? That&#39;s really important...
3051      The latest upgrade is crap.  The notification box (I call it the nag box) that says Dropbox has notifications, Alerts, etc. on startup.... is in an INFINITE loop. click and comes back.  Worked perfectly and loved it until this last upgrade.  2.1.2.  I see a LOT of other people are complaining about the last update.  Iphone 4 running 5.1.1.
2118      And comparatively storage pricing could be more competitive.
1870      I care more about the functionality than the looks, so this review will say nothing about the updated look.  There are some major bugs/problems with the update!!!!  I am no longer given the option to &#34;open in&#34;.  This means, I can look at my Numbers spreadsheets, but I can&#39;t &#34;open in&#34; Numbers, so I can&#39;t work with those spreadsheets or enter any info on them.  Major issue!!!  It makes dropbox completely useless for me.     Please fix this !!!!!
2453      Hey Dropbox team! Please add the ability to rename files, as well as the ability for gifs to play. I know you can do it!!
1733      A multi-million dollars company so useless, don&#39;t know how to create rename file or folder feature in this app.

Close up and go home!!!
2066      Dropbox app is bug ridden and they have no desire to fix basic things. It may work for a while, but eventually it will break and there will be no recourse from Dropbox to fix it. Support will ignore you. Dropbox is extremely arrogant about. Competition is now catching up. Finally and thankfully.
3529      It would be nice to access my files!!!!!! Crashing repeatedly!!!
3260      Dropbox will not open on I pad.  Did yesterday.  This seems like an unstable app.
1861      I&#39;m very disappointed that I can&#39;t open most excel files anymore! Repeated tries works occasionally but it should work every time!
2778      UPDATED REVIEW - EASY TO DO THIS REVIEW - STILL ... THE BEST!!! 

I love this App. I must use it 20 times per day!

I don&#39;t know how anyone who wishes to be productive as a Executive can live without it. I&#39;m able to access everything from archived/stored documents for pinpoint accuracy to a Hi-Def Video on demand. 

Furthermore, my personal life is not put &#39;on hold&#39; for a moment. Just having the ability to share captured moments with loved ones makes this invaluable. 

essential part
1805      Have two issues, first there is no way that I&#39;ve seen to rename items/folders?  Item two is the auto image upload in the background hasn&#39;t worked right since iOS 7 release. In order for the images and videos to sync I have to open the app for it to notice and additions. What happened? This was working wonderfully!?

Please fix the bug that won&#39;t allow me to play video&#39;s!!!
2861      ...are needed. Thanks
2975      The recent update crashes every time when I tried to view a file on my iPad. It is no longer use able.
1606      I had too much videos and pictures and this solved my problem
3457      The latest update caused the program to not back up or update changes to my data. Fix this , or the app is useless!!
2867      I love dropbox, but lately I have had trouble with the app. 
I can log in through safari fine, but when I use the app I keep getting a pop up which won&#39;t go away that says &#34;connect to itunes to use push notifications&#34; the weird thing is, I have all notifications for Dropbox turned off!
I can reinstall the app and then it works for a while, until I switch to a different app or go to the home screen, then I have the same problem. 
Hopefully there will be an update soon to fix this. :(
2218      It does a great job at transferring files from my computer to iphone. No need to use flash drive or sync with iTunes. Needs iOS 7 layout though
2024      Landscape or not, the scroll pane on the left is always visible no the screen. Very annoying as I enjoyed displaying my docs in full screen on previous version. Really hope it&#39;s user error, else this is a weak update.
2019      It&#39;s annoying as all get-out.
2956      Yeah on my phone all day.
2244      I like having my photos in one place.
2122      I question WHO thought it was a good idea to put the data wipe on 10 Code fails here too. Who will use it? it&#39;s seriously a dirty prank waiting to happen to someone. If you don&#39;t like it you don&#39;t have to use it, but its existence just bodes ill.
Pointless rant end.
2431      This is a great app, however, to move apps into a folder I have to go online. I have to overwrite in the app to update a file and then I have to use the web version to move updates files into a folder.
I may be doing something wrong so I&#39;m giving 4 stars for now. If you or anyone can explain that would be great. I&#39;ve looked over the directions and can&#39;t find how to do it all within the app. I want to use the app for its full purpose.
1966      It is a good app, very stable and useful, but please, half of the world population wants a function for file renaming. How many lines-of-code takes to include a renaming feature in your App???

Listen to your customers! Then I&#39;ll give you 5 stars!
3180      and then crash again...useless when I really need it.
3364      I am so mad that you guys bought Audiogalaxy only to shut it down. That app was the best app ever. If this issue is not resolved I am canceling my Dropbox account entirely. I will also be recommending to everyone I know a boycott of your company until this issue is resolved.
2018      Nice major update, overall the app works great. But, one thing that&#39;s still missing is bulk downloads. You can a) select multiple files and b) download files from Dropbox to your phone, but you cannot do both at once. Seems pretty basic a feature to overlook.
1989      This is a sad little update that has obviously been designed by people who never use Dropbox. It now a bare bones app that just lets you view your files, but now has a constant and annoying sidebar that steals screen real estate.
3333      I tried the &#34;Open In Another App&#34; and Dropbox does not come up as an option.  I have documents saved on my iPad Pages, Numbers applications.  And Dropbox was not able to upload any files from these productivity apps.  So I guess I&#39;ll have to email everything to my main computer to upload into Dropbox.  I use my iPad for a lot of school work and I even access the school online discussion tool so this Dropbox app will not work for me.
2930      Every time. So can&#39;t use it at all.  But other than that - fantastic!
3076      PDFs, Jpegs and Word Documents not opening properly.  Everything works on my iPad which I didn&#39;t do the update on, but  not on the iPhone, where I did.  Hope its fixed soon.
3125      Drains battery crazy.
3205      Won&#39;t open... Total freeze then shuts down.
2479      I was excited when I first got this app because of the prospect of being able to quickly listen to demos that I and my band mates had uploaded as we work on a new project. That excitement quickly turned to disappointment as I found that this app does a horrible job of playing back .wav files. Even on my home wifi network I am only able to get a file to play perhaps 1 out of every 10 tries. 

I realize .wav files are huge. I&#39;ve tried pausing playback to wait for the whole file to load but the app freezes and eventually I receive a message that says &#39;Unable to View File&#39;. 

This has been a very frustrating app to use. The only reason I&#39;m giving even a second star is because on occasion, when all of the stars align, or God is smiling down in me,  a file actually plays back. A taste of the way this app should work all of the time.
2272      The app showed its installed in the App Store but it doesn&#39;t show up anywhere on my device.
3114      They worked fine under the old built in pdf reader
2231      This app is great! The only thing I would say is there should be a way to edit and crop photos.
2794      The main issue I have with this app is that there isn&#39;t a &#34;keep me logged in&#34; feature. Please add and I will reward you greatly (with 5 stars) ; )
2788      I don&#39;t always have time to backup my photos on my iPhone. Love how DropBox will do this automatically whenever I have a Wifi connection. Just have to remember to delete the ones I don&#39;t want to keep.
1800      When dropbox comes up, I see the welcome, learn about dropbox and sign in icons.  I am blind and use voiceover.  Nothing happens! I don&#39;t know who to contact about this.  Dropbox works great on my 2 IPods.

Thanks

Jim
2146      Works find with iOS 7. Love Dropbox. Great service. Great app!
2512      ???? ?????? ???????
1779      Just an awesome app! With 58Gb thanks to my college :)
2358      You can&#39;t download any videos into your phone. Like come on I don&#39;t know why yahoo would do this to me making a deal with Dropbox.
2471      Any file size past 15MB has trouble being opened in this app...even on wifi. I&#39;m losing hope that Dropbox will finally make an efficient mobile app for their service.
2855      Over a month and can&#39;t log into my account because of an &#39;expired&#39; password that they neglected to inform me was a out to expire. I have no way to change it and they have yet to respond to the multiple emails I have sent.
2628      I have not been able to use. Please fix.
2630      It used to be awesome! Something changed with the updates. It has become a pain. Disappointed. With updates, it&#39;s supposed to be better not worse.
1904      After the latest iOS update I cannot get in to Dropbox. It crashes every time.  Please fix!
3094      Please include the ability to share (all types of sharing) from within the app and it will be a total win.
2784      I can&#39;t access my files in dropbox on my iPad. I hasn&#39;t loaded for a month! I use dropbox for PDF files for my college classes! Fix this ASAP
2129      First of all you can&#39;t move dropbox files to another dropbox folder even if it is public. You get an error message and you&#39;re asked to try again. Then it wants to upload your entire photo library to the dropbox cloud but you can&#39;t pick and choose which ones. And thirdly, you can&#39;t move photos from dropbox to the appropriate album in your photo library. You can only move them and they get dumped into Camera Roll. Then you have to open Photos and go into Camera Roll and move them into the right album. So that&#39;s three steps that should be one! The desktop version is great so it&#39;s mind-boggling how bad this app is.
2773      Really convenient way of sharing files between 3 devices i have. Sharing with friends is easy. Thank you for Russian language update.
2817      This app is definitely a must have if you use Dropbox. It has a simple and sleek interface and allows you to do a lot of the stuff you can on the desktop version. The best thing about it is you can download images onto your device and also upload images from your device onto Dropbox. It&#39;s come in handy for me a few times now. Seriously recommend this app.
2121      I really NEED to be able to change file names of uploaded pics and vids in the app and download videos to iPad. I will give 5 stars once that is changed. 

It really jams me up when I upload a video and have to wait to send a link off because I can&#39;t change the file name in the app.

In order to change a file name I have to upload from the iPad then open safari and after I sign in I can finally navigate to the location of the file and change it&#39;s name. 

Please make renaming files and downloading videos to iPad an option in the APP!!
1610      Downloaded app and it just doesn&#39;t open. Dropbox not all that great!
2729      It&#39;s ok but u guys need to make a better GUI.
1798      Did I spill whiteout on my screen?
1590      I have no clue why there are so many haters, this is a really good app.
1737      Dropbox is an awesome service, and having it my iPhone is icing on the cake. The app works just as described, and I&#39;ve never noticed any bugs in any of the releases. They release feature updates sometimes, too.

Recommended! ?

I love that I can play a video, exit the app, and still continue to play the audio from that video!
2717      One star until they add share button for folders.
2521      Its a good app i like how it tells the date of the photo the only problem is that the videos take long to load and the quality is terrible! if they can fix that then ill give this app 5 stars :)
1871      Works just as advertised, easy to get used to.
3056      A great concept with flawless execution. I could not be happier with this app and service.
3380      This app doesn&#39;t handle shared folder settings, which is critical to my use of Dropbox. Otherwise it&#39;s pretty solid.
2802      It would be great if you could add one more button which greatly helps sharing folders... It would be next to the delete and move key when you edit folders and it could be a share button that instead of having to click on every single file to share you can do it by folder... Otherwise I have to go to the website and that is a pain on safari.
Thanks
3127      Thanks for nothing dropbox
2771      very convientent
2443      help - I see no where to contact for tech support.  I am trying to upload videos from my iphone 5 Movie Pro app to my Dropbox account.  I keep receiving error that reads &#34;the operation couldn&#39;t be completed.  (NSURLErrorDomain) error 1005.  Is this a Dropbox issue or Movie Pro?
3357      This app could take it to the next level if the audio playback had a REPEAT option.
3004      Simple &amp; easy. Helps me in school
1965      The new design is so bland. You don&#39;t HAVE to make your app look like apple&#39;s stock apps. You can put your own band in it too.
2106      Since the iOS 7 update the files don&#39;t upload to Dropbox even when connected to wifi
2481      This app requires you to have location services turned on to run in the background. I don&#39;t see why the app needs to know from what geographical location I am located to run in the background. It&#39;s a stinking marketing ploy.
2659      Love this app. Great for clearing up space on my phone. The automatic sync with my camera roll is great too.
2525      Wish more apps would integrate the SDK
3524      Please make an update to where you can play an mp3 then it automatically plays the next mp3.
2120      Get DropBox. It is an essential part of every device strategy.
3319      Love it
1937      Where is the beauty in an extremely white design?   It&#39;s painful to the eye!
2470      Really? Location services to be able to upload camera. Whatever. It would be helpful if the app SHOWED UP in location services. For once do an update that improves.
1975      The update is fantastic! Everything is easier to find, looks prettier, and is easy to access. Great job guys!
1731      Great design and all-around service. I&#39;ve been using Dropbox for years for school work and it&#39;s saved me plenty of times when I forgot to pick up my papers from my printer. 

I really wish you could improve the music player though. I was running out of space on my iPad so I had to delete all my music. I was hoping to use Dropbox or an app that plays music off of Dropbox but none of those work. The music player right now isn&#39;t best. It doesn&#39;t have loop, loop one, shuffle, etc. It also takes a lot of time to load each song before they actually play. If you do consider improving the player, also think about how some people organize their music in a folder called Music and sub folders by artists and albums. Perhaps make an option to only play certain folders and/or play all sub folders.
2980      Love it, and the new update is awesome. Can&#39;t wait till I get search in all my documents and music and photos. Also, can we tag people and automatically share?
2156      Very good!
1831      It was an awesome app and then it crashes EVERY thine I launch the app. Open crash open crash open crash. Fix please!
2488      I have used other sharing apps but this is the only one I am using for my business and personal. Stop reading and start using drop box now....it&#39;s the best and only one you will use. I give A+ to those who worked so hard to make our lives easier every day. May God bless you all.
3507      I am a true Dropbox fan and all, I recommend to all my friends to use Dropbox service. But the new icon is just unbearable. It looks so awkward and ugly to be honest. And based from what I have read, it&#39;s not just me who thinks that, many others feel the same way. Please give people what they want, please please, stop using this uncomfortable icon and bring back the old one!!!
2373      Thumbs up if u used this for survival craft
3487      Basic functionality like file rename or access to previous versions of a file are missing.
2046      App is not at all opening... Straight aways crashes upon opening... Please fix this.
1680      Excellent app.  It does exactly what the developers say it does and could not be simpler to use.  It is stable, super fast, and a joy to use.  Infinitely better than sending attachments via email.  Love it.
2461      I really like the app and use it a lot. However, can you make it so that you can delete multiple photos/videos at the same time? Also, I can&#39;t download videos on other devices? Can you make it so that I can?
1541      Did not work on my new iPhone 5s. Only showed sliding logo&#39;s
3283      Love the features it offers...

Dropbox support, would there ever be a way to sync the photo folders with the camera roll on the iPad?  It would be awesome if I could use my Dropbox picture file as a slide show or &#34;picture show&#34;

Thanks!

Lanny
3417      Great app!!
2702      its great and for all the people who don&#39;t like it cuz it does something to ur iPhone then ur iPhone it jacket  up
1878      Recent iOS7 update cause files inside folders to disappear when SORT BY DATE is selected. They reappear after you close the folder by going to root directory and selecting SORT BY NAME then return to folder view. Frustrating bug. Thought my files were deleted, just can&#39;t see them.
3029      ALL 1,300 photos were deleted. I trusted Dropbox as a back up for my photos. I have no way of ever getting those photos back. The only kind of response I&#39;ve gotten from them is a generic response saying they can&#39;t get back to me because there are so many inquires. Never will I ever use them again. DO NOT TRUST THIS APP!
2881      Has problems uploading when not on wifi. When you turn on &#34;use cellular data&#34; you can plainly see a message underneath saying &#34;Dropbox will not use your cellular data.&#34; 

*face palm*  Are you serious?

Other users mentioned the slow uploading and lack of auto upload options. Cannot save videos to iPhone either. Ugh, come on Dropbox.  You can make a good app, we believe!
3085      I like dropbox cuz it&#39;s easy to use and syncs among all devices you are using. I like it more since it enables a sharing folder to share darta with whoever you like securely
1804      Disgusting appearance but useful
1915      Why?
3462      Every time  I try to create an account it says an unexpected error has occurred. So I didn&#39;t even get a chance to use app before it malfunctioned and I had to delete it. I&#39;m just glad I didn&#39;t have to pay for the app.
3225      &gt;&gt; Delete and reinstall, works now &lt;&lt;

App now crashes when opening. I have 853 photos pending due to updating to 6.1 by iTunes restore feature. 

Please fix.  iPhone 4S 6.1
Works on iPad 2 6.1
1978      One of the main things I need Dropbox for opening Pages files. 3.0 simply opens them to a gray screen that says &#34;Pages Document&#34; and doesn&#39;t give me the option I used to have to open the file in Pages. This bug needs to be squished.
1810      Every time I try to open it, it crashes. Y u do this to me.
1723      Charges made without any request and no approval
2483      How do I get MCPE maps and mods? Without iexplorer or any other fake website to get your money
1783      I really love this app!!!
2087      Worked fine last week. Today the app is crashing on all my classroom iPads. Prevents access to exams in a paperless classroom.
1984      I&#39;m not a fan if the new design.  I can tolerate the in-app design, but the icon is hideous.  I&#39;ve had to hide it in a second page folder to keep it from screaming at my eyes every time I look at my phone.  Please change it back.  Please?  Think of the retinas!
2153      This app uses 8GB of space on my iphone. Yet on my computer used only 3GB? Why is it using so much more on my iphone?! Ridiculous!!! Please fix. Or let me choose things I want downloaded to my phone.
2568      Helps to transfer files from me iphone to pc easily
3186      I love Dropbox, but the latest update crashed on my iPhone 5. It will not install update and now I cannot use app on my phone. Help!
2455      There is a bug with manual uploading of photos from camera roll.
2858      It would be cool if it was possible to edit the name of documents on mobile devices like Iphone or ipad.
3303      This update would be a step up if you could actually see PDF&#39;s with it....
1954      I love it, they payed attention to details that you would never appreciate unless you try this use them for some time and suddenly loose them.
1812      It now only works on iOS 7, so it doesn?t work on my iPod Touch anymore.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.
2890      I love it. So easy even a cave man can  use it. I loaded 314 documents in about five seconds. Now I can read and work on documents no matter where I am. The cloud&#39;s got nothing on this. Dropbox rocks.
3031      It&#39;s great but it crashes every time I go on it I can&#39;t even last 5 seconds can you guys pleas fix this
3000      A must have app for college student!
1789      I have an iPhone 4S and on the previous version took 4-5 seconds to start up but now it&#39;s around 1-2 seconds! Also the features (like sliding right on a item to pull up the sharing menu, delete, etc) are awesome!! Very powerful app and I absolutely love it.
1952      Doesn&#39;t work for those of us still on iOS 6.1.4 so I can no longer use Dropbox on my iDevices. Please bring back the older one and have both. Perhaps the iOS 7 version could be named Dropbox 7+ and the iOS 6 version Dropbox 6.
2158      DOES NOT LOAD ANY FILES
2852      My company made is stop using Dropbox because the files aren&#39;t password protected. I now have to use Wulah, and its slow and clunky. I miss you Dropbox!! Make an option for password protection so I can start using you again.
2130      After the supposed iOS 7 update, the app isn&#39;t working on any of my iOS devices like they used to. Crashes on iOS 7, and I can&#39;t even use the search feature on any of my devices, neither iOS 6 nor iOS 7. I try searching and it crashes.....
1849      The new look is okay but I don&#39;t seem to just zoom in with multitouch or pinch zoom in or out. It&#39;s hard and frustrated to say the least.
3418      why cant i print but i can air print on any other program
1920      Why is the option gone to hide the menu and dedicate that screen real estate to full screen viewing of content?? Thank goodness this semester is basically finished. Please prioritize this fix; it was a stupid omission.
2275      Dropbox tends to be unresponsive. I have uploads stuck in limbo apparently.
1964      The new UI looks and feels great, right alongside iOS7!
3422      I work in the field and always need access to my data. I can also backup my note taking app automatically to DropBox. It opens every file flawless!! This app is awesome!!
2073      Ever since iOS 7, the &#34;Open in&#34; option no longer works. No matter which app you choose to open it in, it does nothing, just sits there.

Almost useless now.
2294      Dropbox was fine until I tryed to put the videos from it to my photo library it wouldnt let me! This review would be three stars if I could access my videos.
