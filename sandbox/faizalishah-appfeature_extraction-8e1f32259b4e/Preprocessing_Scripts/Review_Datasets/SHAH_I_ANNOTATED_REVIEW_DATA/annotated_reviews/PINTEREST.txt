150833    amazinnng.	i love this app so much.
154649    Don't attempt to edit your board description.	Apparently, when editing a long board description using this app, it erases everything on the right that you're not able to see. The window is small, so you only see the bit that you're modifying. What you don't see is also what you won't get after editing!
151694    Love it!!	So many good ideas.
151793    Boot at Start-up	Why does it need to boot when you turn on the phone? There should be no reason pinterest needs that permission. Not updating until this is removed.
151407    Ok	Pi n problem has recently beensolved.
153353    Love!!!!!!!
153035    Amazing	I love it
154567    Great	I love Pinterest
151714    Mouse	Outstands apart from the competition...
152110    Great clean App and easy to use	Only feedback would be to improve image fetching in browsers, sometimes it wouldn't load the images that I want to pin, otherwise great work!
151474    Love it.	Can keep up with everything I love in one place. I love it.
153649    To Pinterest people	I logged out and than I tryed to login and all of my stuff was gone. So wtf is that all about. I really not happy with you guys( Pinterest) so can you fixs it?
151114    Ugh.	I hate the new update, it won't let me pin stuff and mever sends link to reset password. Every time you go to a picture it goes to comments first. Hate it. Please fix!
151133    Love this App.	Great App.  I have over 100 boards of interesting topics, crafting interests, recipes, photos, and they all continue to grow.  My husband just started  pinning his own interests.  The  coolest and it's free, for all ages.
152038    Awesome! !!	I can find anything. ..
154200    I love Pinterest!	Boards are a great way to save links to articles I want to read.  I save and post recipes, then just open the app to follow them.  Sending links to friends and pinning is so easy, and fun!
153688    Summary review	I really love this app. Its probably the app I use the most on all of my devices. Its quick and easy to find pins you love. I would suggest maybe adding a feature for making sub folders or subcategories within boards. It would make it easier to organize pins.
151278    Dislike the update...	... That opens links in its own browser instead of my preferred external browser.  :-(
153598    Fantastic app!	I loved it so much! Coz it's very useful for me. I can just pin all my fave recipes!
152016    Easy uploading	Love it!
154853    Thanks
150963    Good	Nice and interesting.
152995    Love it!	Learn so much and get all sorts of great ideas for all kinds of things.
152422    Love it!	Best source for recipes and diy and so much more! Totally addicting and may cause weight gain ;)
151703    :/	I like this App, but what i hate in the last update is the name showen in header when i open the pic.
152351    I find everything on this app!!!	Everything I need, didn't know or just need a laugh, I find here!
152460    You Deserve 5 Stars Pinterest!	You are awesome for creating a place where people can meet and share some of the most beautiful photo's, places of travel, nature, crafts, cards, foods you name it, it's on Pinterest! Your Awesome Debra Smith Los Angeles, Califirnia
154833    I love this app	Its full of great ideas

151583    My favorite app	Love!
153340    Love it , very inspirational to me.
151181    Great, with a couple kinks	I love Pinterest and hope I never have to live without it! I just wish it wouldn't close itself, and that when I close it, it would open where I left off the last time. Also, the search function leaves something to be desired. You have to be too specific.
154365    Easy to pin & navigate
153835    Great	Love this app
153719    Almost perfect	Great app. Sometimes it gets a little buggy when you go to a pin's webpage within the app. It won't let me pin from that page. Other than that it's great if you're a Pinterest lover.
153154    Awesome!	Great app with loads of new and easy ways to access exactly what you want! 10/10.
152367    Addictive!	I love this app. It has officially become what I do most on my phone. Great pictures, quotes, and ideas!
151621    My thumbs are sore :-)	I can describe Pinterest in one word: addictive! Great ideas that are constantly updated
154504    PInterest	It's the best...

152759    Happy Girl	At last. Been waiting for this app. And now i have it i am very pleased. Much easier to navigate.
151790    Best App EVER!	Love Love Love It!
150875    Best, wonderful, cool.	If you are interested in life, freaking download this app. Use this site.  It is awesome.  Take this artistic, scientist, musician, chef's word on this fact.
151538    Only one issue:	All of a sudden, I'm being sent many, MANY pins every day from people I don't know. All of them are for work-at-home "opportunities" and e cigarettes. I DO NOT like being spammed on Pinterest! Please add some way to block pins from people I don't follow! This is INCREDIBLY irritating!
151356    Great!	Good so far!!
153618    Needs feature	I should be able to reorder boards via app & cannot
152979    Luv luv luv	I can just about find anything on this app
153584    Galaxy s4	The best app ever
153718    Rating the app	Would give it a 5 out of 5 but it keeps crashing when I'm pinning! Very annoying and frustrating
151749    Please fix!	Was great until update. Now it's just a white screen & freezes.
151260    Like it	Really like this application
153426    I love Pinterest!!!
152374    Love it!!!	I love pinning all kinds of things and seeing what others have found.

152021    See and Enjoy - Opens My Eyes	The Best of the Best
152010    My favorites	I love their idea and home docor! ???????
152288    Love it!	Works well!
151154    Pinterest	I love this app. The ideas on here are endless. I love DIY's.
152341    Amazing	Super amazing
152333    Excellent	Wunderful
152667    Fun and easy to use	So simple to use and quicker than going through a browser!
153216    Very helpful comes in handy alot
154661    Asking for too much personal information	Stop being so greedy about user information! There is no reason that justifies you to read a user's contact list or what other programs are running. While the app itself works fine I'm highly disappointed regarding your business ethics.
151353    Suddenly poor search results.	Every search brings up irrelevant results. Some searches claim "no results". Do a board search for "Starry night wedding"... We KNOW there should be tons of those. Also, many search results are from Etsy? Please fix ASAP, Pinterest People!
153015    Love it. Addictive and useful.	Just not enough hours in the day!
153610    Just a beginner	I'm new to this app. I'm still learning how to use it but so far so good. How do I follow people and have them follow me?
152230    I love it.	I freaken looove Pinterest.
154462    I think that this application is great.	It's addictive.
152793    Pretty good	Sometimes it gets hung up and gives up on loading pins, but its really grood overall.
154087    Pinterest	Oh well can you please make pinterest more interesting hehehe
153705    Love it
153723    Awesome!	Love this app! Some of the updates are annoying, but it's still great.

154418    Great app	Love it.
153429    Pin	Great app! I love it!
154084    hate	Hate this app so MUCH

154286    :)	I love it!
153122    Love Pinterest	Glad I'm finally able to do Pinterest from my phone, I tried the mobile website, but it had a bunch of problems. Love this app.

154564    I'm addicted! So many DIY ideas, gardening tips, fashion, holiday...
153860    Pinterest!	So great for finding ceeative help!  You name it; someone has something for it, with it, about it! Or you can share YOUR great idea.
154704    Love your site	Wish I had more control on selecting a pin anyplace on the Web to pin. But, not sure you have any control over my wish. If fact bet you wish this too.
152753    I love Pinterest	I am obsessed with pictures so this is a perfect online place to store and organize my interests in pictures
152234    Great	It needs an offline feature to view your own pins without internet connection.
151220    Awesomeness	This app is just epic
152185    mily	love it it helps me bobd with fa
154475    ?EXCELENTE!
154861    Love it!
154335    Love it.	User friendly on my  Motorola droid HD
153262    I love this app	Its great, really easy to use
153581    Best virtual organizing app evah!	I L.O.V.E this app. Perhaps less for how it functions and more for how I have instant access to both mine and others creative activities and vibes.
154233    Sedap lazat
154109    Addictive!	I really love this app. It's fast and easy to use. The only thing I don't like is that when you click on a link it doesn't take you to your own browser. Sometimes I'll start to browse and before you know I have to hit the back button 30 times to get back to the app
154934    Very nice	Very nice and user frendly app
151090    I Love it	Many great ideas.
153495    So fun!	Haven't ever had any problems with app.

154810    Great, especially when you are stuck in a boring meeting
152415    Awesome! You might become "pindicted"	Great app:)
154699    Error "-24"	I recently uninstalled the app and then tried reinstalling it, it won't let me and I keep getting error -24 could you please fix
150974    Love it	Lol cool
155043    Excellent
153315    Love it!!	Easy to use!
155093    Nice	Love Pintrest!!!
153243    Love pinning	Very good app
153914    I know there are pictures!	It would be great if this app worked even half the time....but it doesn't.  I have reinstalled it twice.
151799    Best app iv ever had	Love it
155052    ?	I love this.
154207    I'd rather be Pinning!	It has taken me from "that looks cool" to "LOOK WHAT I MADE!"
155083    Pinterest addict	Love it..
152692    Excellent!!!!	I love this app, its fun and simple. Its amazing :)
150808    Sweet App	Much pics.  So pin.  Wow.
153023    Pretty awesome	Liked everything about it. Wish there was a way to save some of the photos though..
154022    I love it
155081    HTC One
152464    Bummer!	Since the latest update it keeps forcing close. Fix this and 5 stars will come back
151547    Love	Great app, easy fun app to use and great image searcher
153911    Love it!	I love Pinterest!  I use it for everything!  I would give it 5 stars if there was a separate tab or button to click to view only the pins that others have sent you rather than them being mixed in with pins that others have pinned or liked from your pins...  otherwise Pinterest is great!
153074    Excellent app	Works very well and does not crash
153526    Fabulous	An opportunity to show our unique way of fashion and knowledge love it
154423    User friendly	I am enjoying the pinterest app.
154679    Love it!	Such inspiration!  Pinterest is highly addictive and dont know that I could survive without it now.. jk of course. . But seriously,  very great app. Lots of USEFUL information and creative ideas! And to boot ...its a free app to enjoy endlessly! No tech problems. Just superb through and through!
151720    Love it!!	Very addictive but love it.
153159    Good except..	Would be 5 stars but whenever I try to use the shortcut "pin it" option it takes me 7 or 8 tries before I can get it to work.  The "like" and "send" ones work fine, and I don't have problems with anything else! Very annoying, enough that I avoid using it all together. No point using pinterest if you can't pin :)
151904    Freakin awesome	Really easy to use. Love this app for pinning when Im on the go!
150810    Love it!	Very addicting but found the best canning recipes here!
152846    ...	Love thr app it makes my life a bit more easy
151784    Love it	I am always on pinterest.  It is so much fun.  So many great ideas.
150950    Addicting & inspiring	.
154837    Love it. MAKES MY DAY with all the love??
153602    Cannot send pins	Howcome?!?!?!?!
150693    Good	It's a really fun, good & addictive app. But sometimes the links take a long time to load. Other than that great app!
150914    Amazing	It works properly, shorts out every once in a while but its rare, and it pretty easy to understand.
153132    I don't like the new update	The way that we must hold and slide our finger to choose from pin it, favourite and to share. It make harder to pin to my board
151476    Amazing!	Best app
153708    Love it.	I love Pinterest because it has such a wide variety of things. It has DIY stuff and it can be very inspirational. You know that thing you have been putting off for about a month? Yeah, you can probably find inspiration to do it on here!
151422    I LOVE PINTEREST	Best place to pin. Me encanta todo lo Que buscas esta a qui te encantara.
151696    So far so good	Like a lot of things.Very nice.will come back later and possibly give 5 stars.
154630    Brilliant	Excellent, lots of inspirational pictures, a wonderful resource for artists/crafts people.
151301    Love it	Better than expected
151466    Cool site!	Pinterest is a great web site and the app just makes it all that more convenient.
152942    Awesome	Love this app!!
153477    Great	Love it
151985    Addicted!	Best addiction ever! I use it every, single day for just about anything and everything!
154308    Random Pin Button	I loveeeeeeeee the app. I wish we could go to a board and click a random pin button. It would make crafting and dinner fun!
153905    Best app ever.	Obsessed!
151907    Love Pinterest!	I love Pinterest & the Pinterest app is handy, especially when shopping & I want to check a recipe! My only negative with Pinterest is that once I start looking, I spend hours on it!
153516    I love it	I check everyday for new things to create, to be inspired, and to laugh. I like that there is no ad clutter. Bravo makers of Pinterest.
153831    Good apps
153408    Very good!	I love Pinterest!  I've had the app for a while now, no problems have come up so no complaints at the moment. No changes needed.
154214    Love	I am so in love with Pinterest. I find myself looking at when I am at a meeting or while I am watching television with my family.  I enjoy using it on my phone so that I could use the press and hold pin feature.
150972    Searching	This new update has made it very difficult to search for something. Every time I search something it puts twenty in front of the words all accept the first word. Such as I would put easy hairstyles but then it does this easy 20hairstyles. I have tried to get rid of the twenty but happens every time. It gets very frustrating. Not liking to go on pintrest as much as I used to due to not being able to search anything.
153194    Thank you thank you thank you!	Great resources, great deals, great ideas, great great great!
154324    Freezes with a forceclose :(	I noticed through reading the reviews on your ratings that other users are having issues such as myself. My app has not always done this, but its been freezing while scrolling through boards and favorites of whomever i check out. If this is a glitch of sorts, please kindly fix it. I dont want to scroll down for 5min on someones board to find the image i left off at, again and again. -Update: still have crashing problems; frankly, sick of it. Did a factory reset on phone, but still crashing. Comments???
150984    It's not working	The new update causes the app to close and doesn't search what im looking for...
152848    Moon	River
154108    Not working on my tablet	Use to work, now it tells me I am not connected to the server, wtf?
151302    Great	Very easy to use, love it!
152617    Love it!!!	I enjoy the arts and different creations that you can find here. Gives one a different outlook out life itself.
154849    HTC First
151901    Good!!!	Love it???
154034    Love all the Pins
153667    Love it	I love everything about the pinterest app. The only thing it's missing is being able to change the cover photos on the boards.
153259    Better than Tumblr! NEW RATING!	UPDATE: 2/3/14 Pinterest needs to not take up 50 MBS on my phone, I will be uninstalling this app soon if not changed,even if I love it.     Faster, easier , and more options to use. When Pinterest was introduced I thought it was stupid that they're trying to replace Tumblr because at that time it wasn't so slow and had not gone through the major face-lift yet. Anyway I'm not going to compare the two but  I got the App on my phone and have been addicted since. No more Tumblr for me anymore.
151834    Crack	Pintrest is crack, but the good kind of crack.
151346    Excellent app	The first versions of this were a little slow but now the app is great. It has my favorite UI of all my most used apps.
154682    Great	Love this app
153197    Best ever.	Pinterest is amazing. Animals, horses specifically are my absolute favorite. I spend hours at a time on this. There are plenty of things to ooooh and awwwww about.
153096    So much to keep you Pintrest!	Can't eat', don't sleep and can't get any work done. Pintrest get all my time.
150928    Love it	I love pinterest but haven't tried the update yet, hopefully its great.
154262    Don't even want to use since latest update	Freezing & shutting down since latest update. Do not like all the "send to" recommendations either. I will give 5 stars again when shutting down issue is resolved. Very disappointed
152046    Awesome!	Love it
153378    Superrrr
153852    Addicted!! So much to do...	Pintrest is awesome. It would be 5 stars if it wasn't so slow sometimes when loading during pinning.
150769    Pinterest app	Love it
150991    I love it!!!! It's better than twitter and instagram	Easy to use and beautiful pictures &lt;3
153248    "LOVE IT!!!"	"LOVE IT!!!"
152174    Excellent	I had the last version on my htc rhyme and it would freeze alot. But I have a new phone and it works fabulously!
153326    Awesome	Cool
153218    Great
150998    Very good	Good
154347    Super Fun
153738    Needs widget	Now that they updated with a widget much better,
153717    Love Pinterest!

150709    Awesome	Great app and information love it
152130    Love this APP	Can be addictive .
152221    Best App Ever!	Inspiration and ideas from around the globe.
152699    Sumsang GNote 1	Still prefer the 1St version. Easy to Pin from Mobile.  Feb 7,14: Can't view the photos  anymore (if there's no HTTP link). Can that be fix? Sometimes the photo itself is too small, u can't even know what others' posting.
150785    New update, bad search	The search function is FUBAR after this last update
151297    No support from support.	Keep getting "exceeds rate limit" message, even on first pin of day.
151344    Too much awesomeness!	Not enough time!
150855    Ah man... it's all screwed up!	Just updated it. (Anyone thinking of doing the same.. don't!) Searches not working correctly. Getting 20 and 20% in all searches, comments. Laggy. Force closes. I LOVE pinterest. On it all the time. It's my fav app ever.  PLEASE fix these problems!  :'(
154499    I enjoy so much
151147    Awesome!	Best app ever!
151119    Annoying	The app never recognizes if I follow someone. . The interface is ridiculous
152282    Love it!	I have become an amazing cook, it has helped my business,  and is great for laughs as well!
151591    The best	Love the whole app itself helps in many ways
154457    Very nice interface looks great and works fine
152992    Love it!	There are still some bugs, esp when trying to mention someone's name in a pin or comment from my phone..it always changes the name! But other than that I love the app...probably too much! ;)
151463    Love Pinterest =)	=)

152132    Love	Love it

155035    (Y)	(Y)
152379    Fun	Love browsing humor. Always makes me laugh. Just wish they would let me put whatever I wanted on my private boards since no one else can see them.
151270    Great	Great

150966    Love it except new features	I really hate that every time I pin something it suggests a person to send that pin to because they are into the same stuff.... well one of the people suggested to me was someone I deleted off of everything of mine so to have them pop up on pinterest is quite aggravating.  Will delete all updates if I can't I will delete app!

154210    Certified Pinterest Addict	I have never enjoyed any app as much as i enjoyed this... Love all the ideas and the thought to keep it now and read later ..just what i need to get all my life be set up....pin...like...share....
154627    This app is great	The app is almost as good add the desktop version in everyway.  The only difference is you don't get to see other boards the pin you just pinned are pinned to.  Its a shame that isn't part of the app yet, its the best for building your pin communities.  I do love the hold and drag option for repinning/liking/sending on the newer version it makes it so fast and easy.

152790    Pinterest	Pinterest is great, but the app  keeps crashing my phone, every other day puts my account on safe mode, so I have to keep resetting my password. I hadn't had that problem before when I was using the mobile site. Un installed.

152177    Searches and hangs all the time	Very often, the searches just show the pin working on it without any results for 10-15 min. Who has time to wait that long? Lately that's the reason I've reduced the usage of this app. If it doesn't improve, I'll probably discontinue... Samsung galaxy S4
153933    Its a good app ?
151944    Beautiful	Awesome

153986    Love this app!	Sometimes I get lost with time because it is so addicting. It is so fun to look at everything and pin your likes or needs to your own boards. I also use a lot of the ideas I get from Pinterest in my classroom, and I have used DIY ideas for my home!

151701    Love this site	I can quickly find a recipe or an idea that others have done. Good job!
152833    Love it but...	I love Pinterest! I'm not so crazy about this app. Often, very often! when I refresh the main page the screen goes blank...no pins, no way to get the pins. I can switch to a category and have little problem seeing those pins, so I know pins load correctly. So why don't they load on the main page? My other complaint is that sometimes when the page loads and I scroll down, I get to see maybe 15 pics and the page ends, just stops. You know there are thousands of pins to be seen, so Wtf? WAKE UP PINTEREST!
150798    Love it.	Over all wonderful, the only thing I'd that settles it clicks on a board when I'm still scrolling down to find it
150828    Awesome	Love!!
151487    Thank you for this app!	I love pinterest!
152630    Finally!	I love having it at my fingertips.
154322    Bot?	Evertime I log in it says that you've found a bot on my phone but I don't have one. So I uninstalled.
151331    Love it	Love. It!
153290    Love it you could get a lot of ideas and interests you like	Loved it
154620    Almost	Please add ability to change cover photo and explore feature. Thanks!
151272    Pinterest	Pinterest test
151723    Someone bored?	Lots of great & useful information, however... "if it ain't broke....." enough with the updates people. Every time I turn around, there's another one
151470    I am so addicted	I love pinterest.  Way more then any other social media website and app!
150684    Update sucks	Won't pull up anything you search for. Whether it is a person or an object. It says it couldn't find you item.
154094    Ok	I like it
153334    Awesome!	Love to use this on my lunch hour to pass time. Has come in handy several times being able to look at my pins while shopping to see what I need for various projects I have pinned.
152718    Addicted!!!	I work at a craft store and ever since signing up for Pinterest and following multiple beading and jewelry pages I've become addicted! Karma was coming and it finally hit ;) next paycheck please :)
151750    Thumbs up	Amazing
152408    Only 4 stars	I would be willing to give it 5 stars but due to the difficulty with pinning from online with my tablet, I give it a lower rating. It discourages me from using it on my tabet
154826    Love this app, I am addicted! Highly recommended
153569    Too much fun. Informative and entertaining.
152137    Good	Greatest  idea ever
