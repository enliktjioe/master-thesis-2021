    <text>My wife and I share a 100GB account, and it's amazing! So many things:

Automatic photo/video upload, iPhoto import, works with the Mailbox app, shared folders, photo aggregation on the website and mobile, the ability to store files only on the cloud (saves space on my Mac from old files)...

...and the obvious things like having everything backed up in real-time, and accessibility of my files from anywhere.

I could do without it anymore! Remember when we just had computers and hoped they didn't break and lose all our files?

One suggestion: if I have automatic photo upload on and download a photo to my phone's camera roll (say, for #TBT), don't automatically re-upload it to Camera Imports! It's already in Dropbox, silly. And yes, obviously if I use Instagram or some other photo sharing software to doctor it, I know it's a different photo and will therefore upload.</text>

I had to upload all the pictures to a named folder, then I had to use the Internet browser to login to Dropbox and then send the link to the folder from there.

That so far is my only complaint, but its a big issue for me.</text>

    <text>I generally love Dropbox, but since I upgraded to iOS 7 I can no longer view html files properly (I am referring to files saved on my Dropbox as .html). I used to view them displayed nicely as web pages, but now I just see the source code instead! Can you please fix that??

Also, can you please add the option to copy and move files? It would be a very useful feature!! Thanks!</text>

    <text>This is not a review of the Dropbox service (which is great) but of this app, which can use a lot of improvements. The single most frustrating thing about it is that it displays only a dozen or so characters in a file name. Since I have thousands of files, some with long and descriptive names, it is impossible to find what I'm looking for unless I download the files to the iPad one by one. There is no way to resize the file list to make more of the files visible. Why not?</text>

    <text>Dropbox, we're supposed to upload our photos and video, but where will it all go? With the amount of photos and video we take, 100 or 200GB won't last more than a few years, let alone be a permanent solution. Please offer a different storage system for photos and video for power users. 

And please, add the ability to tag photos and video. There is no way to navigate Camera Uploads with any amount of speed and efficiency. We need a way to display our photos once we have stored them; right now it is a giant useless folder. An Evernote system of tags and saved searches would enable us to keep all photos/video in one place and still sort them when needed. 

Great service overall, but you come up short in photo/video storage. Take a cue from Flickr: charge a fee for unlimited media storage. I'd still pay for a separate 100GB document storage, which is what I have now.</text>

    <text>Even Google Drive can refresh folders. 

Some simple suggestions to increase usability:

1. Currently, you have to leave the folder and come back in if you wish to refresh that folder. Let me refresh my folder with a refresh button so that I can view changes to files in a more streamlined manner. If I am constantly compiling a document on my computer and using my iPad to check that it looks okay or if I am constantly editing a photo and want a high quality, true color representation, then...#REFRESH!
2. Refresh Button
3. Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents.
4. The air smells a bit. Why don't we REFRESH it?
5. It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button
6. Mentos: The Refresh Button Maker
7. There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button.  Nothing is there at the moment. It's lonely...
8. Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an F, Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an S, Give me an H! What does that spell? Easily implementable refresh button with high utility even to people who don't know they need it yet! Yaaay!</text>

    <text>I gotta say, overall I like this app, although the logic behind the 15 min cap on streaming alludes me. I thought they may have imposed it to reduce bandwidth, but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth. The reason is because I start downloading the whole file, then start streaming it. Once the 15 min is up, I then switch to the downloaded file. To me, this uses more data. Why can't I just stream the whole thing? Overall, though, I like everything else about this app.</text>

    <text>Nice major update, overall the app works great. But, one thing that's still missing is bulk downloads. You can a) select multiple files and b) download files from Dropbox to your phone, but you cannot do both at once. Seems pretty basic a feature to overlook.</text>

    <text>I just got the app. I tried to log in on my iPad but it would not let me. I tried my email and my username. I tried different variations of my password. Nothing worked. So I reset my password, being careful to check spelling, etc. then I logged onto the desktop site (still on iPad) and it worked. I went back to the app but it would not work. I've used this app multiple times in the past, so I'm frustrated that it's just now not working.</text>

    <text>somethings wrong with the last update.
i only can view pdfs once. 
after opening for the first time, cannot view them anymore!

the latest update fixed the issue of crashes and also can view the pdfs without problem. thanks a lot for your work!  however there is still a problem which is that when you try using the &quot;open in&quot; option in other iPad applications, and ask to open in Dropbox, the filed just opened shows up in the iPad Dropbox application, but the Dropbox server is not updated... meaning that file is not found in the Dropbox folders if you access the folders in a different device/computer, etc...</text>

    <text>Nice design refresh. Looks great. 

I love this app. Dropbox totally saved me at work. I had to email a bunch of large files and the work email system wouldn't take it. 

Dropbox worked flawlessly. Not only did they get links to download the files, but they could also view content right in their web browser. PDFs, Word docs, and videos all were viewable in the browser for them. It made presentations a breeze! 

I now use Dropbox for personal use too. Love it.</text>
