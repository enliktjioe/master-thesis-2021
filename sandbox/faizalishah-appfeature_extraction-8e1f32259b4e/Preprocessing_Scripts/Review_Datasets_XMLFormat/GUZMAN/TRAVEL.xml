    <text>I like the app so far.
I'm constantly using the other &quot;Y&quot; for foodie trips, but I can see that for International and tourist locations this app has more content.
And they even have an app that loads to your phone and no data is required (as long as you load the city before you use it)</text>

    <text>There was nothing wrong with the old version, and this new one eliminates one of the apps most useful features: previously your saved restaurants, hotels, etc, were automatically sorted by location, now all of them are shown at once which is really confusing.

True you can ask to see your saved hotels in say only Chicago, but if you then want to look for your saved restaurants in Chicago, you have to do a second sort.  This is a pain especially when you are in a location with a poor signal.

    <text>I've been contributing to TripAdvisor for many years now.  It is the first place I check when heading to a new area for information on hotels, restaurants and activities.  The app on my iPad makes it easy for on-the-go reviews.  It is easy to use and quite intuitive in how it works.  No complaints.</text>

    <text>It is impossible to refine a hotel search for specific criteria beyond location, price and quality. Those are well done and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA. Especially during peak seasonal flows, many of us travel with pets. We have a terrible time finding clean, reliable hotels. Most sites for pet travel are woefully inadequate. How hard would it be to include this as an additional search filter? That would bring in helpful reviews that would not only enhance the site experience but also improve the field.</text>

One small issue I have is that when you ask what's near you, or when you use a filter, not everything shows up.  An example is that I was trying to find info on a brew pub near our motel.  It didn't show up on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location it didn't show up in the search.  But, when I searched by name, there was the pub and reviews.</text>

I've seen hotels rated a 4 that in my opinion were really a 5. If you read the most current reviews you will get the best feel for the hotel. Dining is more subjective and the rating don't always meet my expectations. Again look for the ones written in the last few days. An extra I really like are the street maps and metro guides. Very hard to get lost if you use their guide. Very easy to find how to get to your destination. Overall, the guides are the best travel tools one could use.</text>

    <text>Locations on maps are incredibly inaccurate.

Go horseback riding? Come to the historic Centro, where it is mapped but doesn't exist. The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house.

Next problem, related to this is the &quot;Near Me&quot; function. First, the app couldn't find me. Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town. When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse. The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house.

Lastly, the new version is less functional than the previous version. And it's a lot less functional than the website.

Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed. I am definitely unhappy with this version.</text>

    <text>I always read all the reviews while we are traveling on the road. My husband and I crisscross the country every summer and I am the navigator. I find most reviewers to be honest if you read all of them or at least half, you can get a pretty good opinion. Many times I didn't pay attention to a negative review because I thought they had some sort of personal problem and was sorry afterwards. Trip advisor is a good opinion to take into account when you are traveling in a new place and have no idea where to go.</text>

    <text>TripAdvisor has apparently decided it is not important for people to use the map to do searches for hotels anymore.  They had a great interface in the previous version, but they have seen fit to &quot;simplify&quot; it to the point of uselessness.  Gone is the ability to pan the map and have your search applied to a new area.  Gone are the excellent filters for refining your search.  What are you thinking TripAdvisor? The app is essentially useless for me now!!!</text>
