    <text>Ack! I need to do user testing with a clickable PDF this week and have ALWAYS used Dropbox because it's been awesome in the past. Now though, all my clickable PDFs don't work - nothing is clickable and my hotspots don't work. This is super frustrating - especially because I found nothing else that can compare to Dropbox and really rely on this feature to work! PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP. Right now I'm hating the app because you guys took away this core piece of functionality that I desperately need, but PLEASE add it back soon and all will be well again.</text>

    <text>This is not a review of the Dropbox service (which is great) but of this app, which can use a lot of improvements. The single most frustrating thing about it is that it displays only a dozen or so characters in a file name. Since I have thousands of files, some with long and descriptive names, it is impossible to find what I'm looking for unless I download the files to the iPad one by one. There is no way to resize the file list to make more of the files visible. Why not?</text>

    <text>Love Dropbox. Easy to use and convenient across my iPhone iPad and MacBook. Only thing is they need to offer better customized pricing for upgrade plans. 100 GB is nice but an average user may only need 25/50/60 etc. how about pricing that meets low level user needs not just 100gb or more.</text>

    <text>For cloud storage, Dropbox is an excellent solution for me.  I don't usually save a whole lot of files to it, so the smaller, free account has been adequate so far, but when it comes to transferring files to other machines without a USB drive or accessing from my phone, Dropbox has been a very useful tool for me.</text>

    <text>Im on a crappy hotel wifi that goes in and out. Been trying to download a 1gb file for over 2 days now. But for some reason dropbox has not allowed favorited downloads the ability to resume  and instead restarts the download from the beginning every time it fails. It's almost 2014. We have the technology to RESUME A DOWNLOAD what's the problem here?</text>

    <text>Don't expect any product support with this software.

I am new to this sort of software, and I was concerned whether simply accessing photos several times each month would put me at risk of running over the monthly GB alloted by by phone carrier. They're downloaded from the Cloud, right? And anytime you download from the Cloud, you're transferring data, right? So it makes sense that, if you look at your pictures frequently, just accessing Dropbox on your iPhone will explode your data transfer byte usage.

I would have thought this a basic concern to anyone who has to pay a carrier for their cell phone usage; but (a) I couldn't find any documentation on this, (b) I couldn't even get an answer on the internet, which shocked me, and, most egregiously (c) I couldn't get a response from Dropbox itself, despite begging them multiple times for an answer to this simple question.

I'm not about to use this product if it's going to send my phone bill through the roof, and I told Dropbox so. They couldn't care less. When you send them an email asking for help, they send you back an email saying, effectively, &quot;We're terribly busy, but if you really need help send a reply to this email.&quot; Well, don't believe it. I've tried it twice, and after weeks of waiting not a peep.

Incidently, I am also unable to access the Dropbox forums, despite having an account. When I try, I am told that my email address isn't verified -- this, despite the fact that they sent me a boilerplate email asking me why I wasn't using their product (isn't that a laugh). They have an automatic troubleshooter for this problem, but it doesn't work, either. If I could access the forums, I might be able to get a response to my concern there; but Dropbox wasn't interested in answering my separate email on this matter, either.

I say without malice that the support for this product is about as bad as I've ever seen in nearly 30 years of working with computers. Don't expect any help with it from Dropbox. As soon as I can get an answer to this question about data transfer from one of their competitors, I'll be going with them.

Great product idea. Abysmal product support.</text>

    <text>Works great until you open a word document. The formatting on it is terrible. The tab and paragraphs are all messed up and overlapping. Hopefully this big I fixes soon. I love Dropbox other than that.</text>

    <text>I was able to use Dropbox with this update only once. After that, it just keeps &quot;Loading...&quot; and after a minute it crashes. I restarted my iPad but it didn't change anything. Please correct this!!!</text>

  <sentence id="72">
    <text>Dropbox for iPhone and iPad both work exactly as expected.  Any document that I place in the Dropbox folder on the desktop of my MacBook is automatically and almost instantaneously, depending on the size of the file, synced to my iPhone 4S and third-generation iPad.  Third-party support with services such as CloudOn in particular makes iOS functionality even more excellent.  Dropbox is by far the best personal cloud file service out there, and I certainly recommend Dropbox over SkyDrive and Google Drive.  I have found both SkyDrive and Google Drive problematic and finicky, especially the Mac OS X application for Google Drive. Dropbox is always flawless, and this iPhone and iPad Dropbox application certainly illustrates this reliability.</text>

  <sentence id="73">
    <text>I uploaded all camera pics on my iPad when downloaded this app and I have found that there is no easy way to move the photos into folders so that I can only share pictures from a recent vacation.  I have iOS7.  Why is there no move function on this app or am I missing something????  I do not want to share one photo at a time.  Not impressed.</text>

  <sentence id="74">
    <text>Before no update the upload of picture was so fast but now after update it's so slow. For just 1 picture cannot upload. What happened?</text>

  <sentence id="87">
    <text>Decent app but it's probably the slowest loading/performing app I have. Also occasionally just goes black for no reason and I have to restart. They need to quit updating every two or three days and actually take time to make a version that works properly</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="88">
    <text>This app needs the ability to search the files by title or by words and phrases in the documents. Also needs the ability to select and download multiple files at one time. Otherwise the app works well.</text>

    <text>Do not use dropbox with iOS7! It crashes my ipad (iPad 3) and doesn't let me open files. The top menu bar sports a hybrid iOS6/7 look on the left and right sides too, it's very strange. I hope they update it soon. I think you can get away with using the dropbox site through safari to get through this in the meantime. I had no problems with dropbox on iOS6.</text>

  <sentence id="104">
    <text>I really like this app but but for an app that is supposed to automatically sync this one has a big hole. I was using this to do some testing of an ePub file I found that syncing didn't work.

I selected the ebook and sent it to an app. So far so good. I found some errors which I fixed on my PC and reloaded the file on Dropbox. I then went back to Dropbox on my iPad and used the pull down which showed it to be my latest. I pushed the file to my test reader but it was still the old file!

My work around is to select some other file on Dropbox and then reselected the real file and pushed it again. This time it worked.

Hopefully this will get fixed.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="105">
    <text>I gotta say, overall I like this app, although the logic behind the 15 min cap on streaming alludes me. I thought they may have imposed it to reduce bandwidth, but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth. The reason is because I start downloading the whole file, then start streaming it. Once the 15 min is up, I then switch to the downloaded file. To me, this uses more data. Why can't I just stream the whole thing? Overall, though, I like everything else about this app.</text>

    <text>I am a fan. Easy to use. Fast transfer. What I like to see is a way to share a folder and not just a file. I would want to do this all here in the app and not go to the site anymore. If you do this, I'd go for five stars. :)</text>

    <text>Dropbox used to be among one of my favorite apps - fast, easy to use, and pretty. 

Now, I am no longer presented with the ability to upload photos one at a time from my ios photos albums, and must instead upload EVERY photo. I do not wish to share every photo with those I share folders with. 

 If this isn't what Dropbox intended with this update and/or I am actually at fault, they've certainly made it more difficult to accomplish the task of uploading single photos at a time. Upon this update, I have been forced to switch to a different service.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="138">
    <text>If i want to enable background camera upload, it asks for the location. I do not use my cellular network for camera upload. So the only option is the WiFi.

Why would an app asks for location if it only uses the wifi. Just check if it is connected to a wifi access point or not?

Other than that, the app is great, fast and easy to use. But the major reason for me to use the dropbox mobile app is camera upload. So, three stars till this location thing changes.

    <text>I am a big fan of DropBox in general but the recent upgrade for the iPad version cannot view excel files... which is an obvious and very basic problem to miss.

    <text>I will not be updating Dropbox on my other devices because I refuse to update to the hideous ios7 or ios7 &quot;look and feel&quot; apps.

Similarly every single app that gets updated to a &quot;beautiful&quot; ios7 look is one I will not update. The only exception to this is Steam which looks great still.

Why can I view a long filename on the iPhone app yet NOT on the iPad app?  This is just silly.  Please, dropbox business managers and developers; demonstrate that you listen to reasonable requests for sensible GUI improvements and FIX THIS. 

Also,  I cannot believe that it is not possible to sort files by upload date or some other field.  As far as I can see the files are always listed alphabetically.

    <text>I LOVE Dropbox. In fact, my iPad would be useless without it. I need THAT much space. My only issue is that it still is taking FOREVER to upload videos I recorded. Like over an hour. Once it even got 65% of the way there, but then 15 mins later, it said &quot;couldn't connect to Dropbox.&quot; And all the time that it is uploading I have to keep tapping to keep my iPad awake (because there is no &quot;Do Not Go To Sleep&quot; setting for this app) AND you have to keep it in Dropbox because it cannot upload in the background. I do not blame Dropbox for this, because it easily uploads in the background on my Droid. I love this app, just wish it had a few more setting options or resolved the uploading video issue.</text>

    <text>whenever i establish a relationship with a vendor who requires an email address from me, i give them an email address unique to just them.  i give that email address to no-one else and, in most circumstances, i will never send an email _from_ that email address.  

that is exactly what i did with dropbox.

i signed up for a dropbox account almost a year ago, on march 21, 2012.  i immediately received the standard &quot;welcome&quot; email.  over the course of the next nine months i received exactly three additional marketing-type emails from them.

then i started getting spam/phishing emails.  on 19-feb-2013 i received an email saying my direct deposit had been disallowed; on 26-feb-2013 i received an email indicating new security was being put in place for ACH and EFT transactions; and on both 27-feb and 28-feb-2013 i received an email asking me to join a linkedin account.  all four emails were phishing emails.

since i have never shared that email address with anyone, since i had never sent any email _from_ that address, and since the emails were all phishing emails, then one of three things has happened:

- dropbox sold, gave away, or otherwise shared my information with one or more dubious with parties.

- someone hacked dropbox's systems and stole my information.

- dropbox has one or more rogue employees who is using customer information for their own benefit.

i used dropbox's web form to contact two different departments about the security breach, and i also sent two email messages about the security breach from the email address i had given them but to date i haven't heard a single thing.  

dropbox has a legal obligation to inform all impacted customers about any security breach.  a security breach is what happened here and they are nowhere near fulfilling that obligation.</text>

    <text>Dropbox is a great platform ? until you have a problem.  I've been a premium paying customer for over a year -- not because I needed the extra space, but because I've used it as my backup and sharing platform for a major project.  Last month I had a problem where the app was using up all available CPU on my mac.  Emailed support, and they gave me various random solutions to try which required repeatedly syncing all 5 gig of files and losing all the 'last modified' info which is essential for version control.  After 3 random &quot;try this&quot; tech solutions they simply stopped responding to emails, and never provided any other recourse or even answered my question whether phone support was available -- a question I asked them 5 times.

    <text>I use Dropbox every day. This app is how I backup my notes, transfer them between all my devices, and access them to study. My issue is that all my notes are large PDFs. For some reason, when I load a file, the file seems to get stored in the app data for dropbox. And it seems like more than that gets stored in there because after a while I end up with a dropbox app taking up 1+GB of space on my iPad. This is difficult because I have a 16GB iPad and have lots of other apps on here for studying and need to conserve space. The only way I have found to clear this memory is to uninstall the app every time it balloons, which, as you can probably guess, is extremely annoying. If someone can tell me an easier way to clear this space or if Dropbox can fix this issue, this would be a five star app for me.</text>

I love this App. I must use it 20 times per day!

    <text>I was excited when I first got this app because of the prospect of being able to quickly listen to demos that I and my band mates had uploaded as we work on a new project. That excitement quickly turned to disappointment as I found that this app does a horrible job of playing back .wav files. Even on my home wifi network I am only able to get a file to play perhaps 1 out of every 10 tries. 

I realize .wav files are huge. I've tried pausing playback to wait for the whole file to load but the app freezes and eventually I receive a message that says 'Unable to View File'. 

This has been a very frustrating app to use. The only reason I'm giving even a second star is because on occasion, when all of the stars align, or God is smiling down in me,  a file actually plays back. A taste of the way this app should work all of the time.</text>

    <text>First of all you can't move dropbox files to another dropbox folder even if it is public. You get an error message and you're asked to try again. Then it wants to upload your entire photo library to the dropbox cloud but you can't pick and choose which ones. And thirdly, you can't move photos from dropbox to the appropriate album in your photo library. You can only move them and they get dumped into Camera Roll. Then you have to open Photos and go into Camera Roll and move them into the right album. So that's three steps that should be one!

In order to change a file name I have to upload from the iPad then open safari and after I sign in I can finally navigate to the location of the file and change it's name. 

Please make renaming files and downloading videos to iPad an option in the APP!!</text>

    <text>Great design and all-around service. I've been using Dropbox for years for school work and it's saved me plenty of times when I forgot to pick up my papers from my printer. 

I really wish you could improve the music player though. I was running out of space on my iPad so I had to delete all my music. I was hoping to use Dropbox or an app that plays music off of Dropbox but none of those work. The music player right now isn't best. It doesn't have loop, loop one, shuffle, etc. It also takes a lot of time to load each song before they actually play. If you do consider improving the player, also think about how some people organize their music in a folder called Music and sub folders by artists and albums. Perhaps make an option to only play certain folders and/or play all sub folders.</text>
