  <sentence id="3">
    <text>I got the update and it turns off when it lods</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="4">
    <text>This update is plain bad. It's one thing to make the levels challenging but to make them near impossible with no real reward, well, that misses the point entirely. I didn't finish Bad Piggies and won't be finishing this either.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="5">
    <text>I love the angry birds collection and have them all, except for angry piggies which I will buy later</text>

    <text>It said there is a new pink bird in the birthday level but I have not seen it</text>

  <sentence id="11">
    <text>I wasn't even able to load the first level before crashing. Brilliant.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="12">
    <text>I have to agree with many other reviewers. The new levels are awful, and completely away from the traditional &quot;Angry Birds&quot; gameplay. It's more of a frustration, than enjoyment. You will end up with panic disorder, racing to get the egg away from the bad piggies, in their impossible to destroy contraptions and an impossible to control bird!!!

I get that they want to &quot;spice&quot; up the game a bit. But, that is what they made the other Angry Birds Games for! What they should have done, was create a whole different game for these new kinds of gameplay. 

Hopefully, it is beyond clear to them, that not too many people enjoy these new levels. The regular gameplay was just fine. The traditional gameplay is one of the things that make this game great. Why try to change it, if it didn't need to be changed to begin with? 

Well Rovio, hopefully you have the same person who came up with these awful new levels, reading our fabulously accurate reviews, so they get the hint that it stinks??!! 
Furthermore, we do hope you take our reviews seriously, and do your absolute best not to flub up any more levels on a game that was great just the way it was!!  ??????
?????????????
It WAS Great fun!!! AND, it WAS Fun for ALL ages too!!</text>

  <sentence id="13">
    <text>I love this awesome game! The Mighty Eagle? Awesome! So for a great game, I give you 5 stars. I love the entire Angry Birds series! Keep it up!</text>

    <text>Please fix issue for iPhone - every time I'm playing the game and a phone alarm, incoming call, text, etc pops up (which I hit the snooze or ok button) the sound then goes off the game and the only way to fix it is to reboot phone). Please help!</text>

    <text>I love Angry Birds, but hate the new feathers levels. Definitely a step in the wrong direction, enough to make me write my first review ever in hopes that you do not continue with this version of AB. Lets just pretend this never happened and go back to our old ways, ok?  Ok.</text>

    <text>This is Gerch's favorite app.  Gerch loves to see how many reindeer dragons she can fit in her park to match her favorite reindeer sweater - Love Gerch *o*</text>

  <sentence id="19">
    <text>Constant pop ups trying to sell &quot;super birds&quot; that don't really do much take away the pleasure of the game.  It is quite annoying.  I think the time has come to delete my old pals A Birds.  Sad.</text>

    <text>I love this update but change how pigs look in the other episodes</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="24">
    <text>So my 5 year old plays this game and when we were at the fair he was beating pigs. And pretends like all eggs are his bloody precious and try's to strangle my wife when she makes scrambled eggs.</text>

    <text>Great game worth the dollar</text>

    <text>Since the last update this game crashes constantly and is unplayable. iPhone4S</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="27">
    <text>I love Angry Birds. However, the reset time after the last effort is very irritating. Having to wait until the last bird poofs away gets tiresome.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="28">
    <text>What a waste of time. The tapping and aiming is so frustrating. I've gotten three stars on three levels and played all day. Very disappointed in these levels. I wish I could have given it no stars for the review. I guess I'm back to waiting for new normal levels. Thanks for raising my hopes and then crushing it with this crap</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="29">
    <text>I have all the angry birds games and love new levels.   This most recent update is awful.  It pretends to be angry birds but it isn't.   I find it frustrating to play and not fun at all. I am hoping Rovio gets the message and sticks to adding regular levels in the future.</text>

    <text>This game is really cool. I like it and I think people will enjoy it. Make sure you check out the other Angry Birds games.

    <text>So,how can you come out with a game where the good guys are so weak and slow compared to the bad???</text>

  <sentence id="43">
    <text>Good game and make bad piggies free please</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="44">
    <text>This game is perfect for all you boring people out there......... It's the same on every level. Why are pigs stealing eggs??? Why are they green??? Why do birds even need a slingshot, can't they just fly anyway??? So many questions... Stupid, repetitive, boring game. Don't buy. Save your money for gameloft.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="45">
    <text>I love angry birds but this new level is really unpleasant and confusing.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="46">
    <text>Some have complaints but I think it's pretty addicting! Once the bugs were fixed it runs great and I never have a dull moment waiting in line, when I'm on break at work, or riding in the car.</text>

  <sentence id="47">
    <text>Latest version totally shuts down my music when opening this to play. Fix this!</text>

    <text>I love all of the games. So does my 4 yr old son. He's better than a lot of adults are. I play on my 3rd gen iPod touch. I just wish this thing could go past iOS 5. I'm always looking forward to updates tht include new levels. Keep it up Rovio!!! You guys are the kings of the gaming world!!!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="51">
    <text>Still good game and I also like the cartoons. My kids love them.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="52">
    <text>Awesome Game</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="53">
    <text>It is basically a completely different game. One that is more frustrating and annoying. I really don't like the time pressure!!!</text>

  <sentence id="54">
    <text>Great iPhone game.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="55">
    <text>I love this game, it's so irresistible I can't put it down!!!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="56">
    <text>The &quot;Red's Mighty Feather&quot; update has completely turned me off to Angry Birds.  The mechanics are completely different, the strategy/problem-solving aspect is totally gone, and if your shot is so much as a pixel off from what the developers apparently intended, you essentially fail and have to restart the level.

The &quot;Red's Mighty Feathers&quot; levels are frustrating, poorly designed, and just not fun.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="57">
    <text>It is a fine game intill all of the ads comes and blocks the screen, and the new powerups are not smart. I bought this game to injoy a game the old fashion way, not cheep my way out of the levels</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="58">
    <text>Says to update, but won't! Updated 10 other apps in one minute, but this one won't even begin updating after 5 minutes.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="59">
    <text>love the game. So much fun. But it is not fair that in Ham 'Em High , we have to log onto facebook and like you, because we paid for the app, so we should get the levels, and some of us don't have a facebook account, i paid for the app, I should get the levels. I would like you guys on facebook but i can't because i dont have a facebook account. I brought the mighty eagle on my ipod but it didn't transfer to the app on my iPhone. So buy once unlimited use is a lie.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="60">
    <text>Players who want to play would have bought it earlier.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="61">
    <text>Birdies are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="62">
    <text>I really like the new levels. I think it would be cool if you added a level creator where you could make levels and share them with friends.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="63">
    <text>Time just flies when your having fun.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="64">
    <text>Bird does NOT go where I tap the screen in the new levels. It seems to either lock onto a pig, or shoot horizontally no matter where I hit the screen. Not playing again without an update</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="65">
    <text>not the one i know and love</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="66">
    <text>Why do I have to wait so long to get past the ad for [whatever the ad is for-I refuse to pay attention to it since I paid for the app]. I might as well play a game that doesn't penalize me for playing.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="67">
    <text>The new update has a huge bug that causes some of the missions to have the targeting locked on a certain point no matter where you press. This is game breaking.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="68">
    <text>Are the best yet....love the new gameplay and goals...totally awesome. Can't wait for more levels and hopefully a boss level with King Piggy</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="69">
    <text>Add icould support to the game so your purchases and records can be save so when ever you want to delete and download the game again thank you</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="70">
    <text>Best game app ever! Second to none!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="71">
    <text>Seems the new ones only take speed. Accuracy is more challenging to me.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="72">
    <text>Sorry Rovio-------this new level just doesn't do it for me. Not to mention, you took the original music away! ??

Really wish there was an option to keep the original tune or not!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="73">
    <text>I waited 2 hours in order to get this app. What a rip off!!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="74">
    <text>BEST APP UPDATE EVA!!!!!!! Lol</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="75">
    <text>This is the best game!!!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="76">
    <text>The new version is not good. While I like the gist of the concept, the levels get harder with the moving target and set you up at an unfair advantage. You also don't get any additional tools to gel fight the pigs and you find yourself quickly going over your quota of shots by level 6. Not worth the update.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="77">
    <text>Not enjoying the new update. 
+1 for trying a new idea but its not fun</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="78">
    <text>I thought I paid .99 to remove ads but apparently they're back. This is completely unfair Rovio.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="79">
    <text>??Some people are so annoying they are like is boring, is this a scam?, etc. I love this game?? and why would you want the same game on more then one of your iPod, iPad, iPhone??</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="80">
    <text>Love the new level! Can't stay off it! Keep up the good work.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="81">
    <text>I love it</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="82">
    <text>I am having a blast with this new update! Thank you! I am a big fan!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="83">
    <text>If they were going for the &quot;New Coke&quot; effect it worked. It is back to real angry birds and is better then ever.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="84">
    <text>Please bring back the trajectory line or at least make it to where you can turn it on or off. That's one of the thing I loved about the game before and why it's been a while since I've played it. I have all of then except Rio. I love the fact the both Star Wars has then but not sure why you got rid of them on the original and seasons.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="85">
    <text>Go download bamboo wallet and use the code AC1789176. Thx (???)</text>

    <text>This is my favorite game</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="87">
    <text>Dear Angry Bird team, me and and a group of people had been discussing the matter of writing to you about an idea of the same Angry Birds concept but in the Marvel super hero perception, the same as Angry Birds Star Wars but Marvel. Please take our concern. 
Thank you for reading.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="88">
    <text>I like angry birds cause it's cool</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="89">
    <text>Angry Birds used be a fun and addicting game, and now the latest update has absolutely RUINED the game! &quot;Red's Mighty Feathers&quot; is WAY too difficult! I appreciate a good challenge, but this is just ridiculous! The newest levels are literally IMPOSIBLE to complete and are flat out frustrating! Do NOT download this game because Rovio has ruined the game that we've come to love, and if you have the game, don't update it! Rovio needs to fix the game and get rid of the new levels, or else they're going to lose a lot of fans and the franchise is going to fail! Not even worth one star.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="90">
    <text>Thank you for making this game so so cool LOL!!!!!!WOW!!!!!!!!</text>

    <text>It was great!!! Then it was updated and I was super excited!! The levels looked awesome!! But I can't play them, not any levels, even the ones I already beat.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="94">
    <text>I have not encountered any problems so far with this app.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="95">
    <text>Angry birds went from 5 stars to 1 star. This new level is really disappointing it is not fun, I missed the original game I'm playing it just to get over with it. I felt like I lost my interest in Angry Birds. Too bad.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="96">
    <text>Glad the designers listened to the fans.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="97">
    <text>It's not working for my iPod fourth gen. It doesn't even let me get to the actual gameplay</text>

  <sentence id="99">
    <text>Why change a good thing?</text>

  <sentence id="100">
    <text>I can't get passed the first level because it crashes</text>

  <sentence id="101">
    <text>Keep it up Rovio!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="102">
    <text>Another update!  Glad that the developers keep up on the apps. 

The update is great and the retina display is a welcomed addition. 

The game is number 1 for a reason. The fans made it #1, not Apple.</text>

  <sentence id="107">
    <text>I updated this app. When I opened this app, it erased all my data. I will never play this app again</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="108">
    <text>I used to enjoy it but now with Bad piggies and next it is more and more difficult to get 3 stars, it is not fun anylonger; stay away from it, specially the red' feather crap, not the classic episode, it is garbage</text>

    <text>Best app game ever</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="118">
    <text>The new Angry Birds episode (Red's Mighty Feathers) is a piece of JUNK.  It is not worth an update. If this is the kind of garbage we have to look forward to then I am done with Angry Birds.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="119">
    <text>Could be the worst thing I have seen. Great stuff usually from Angry Birds. This however does not make any sense. Hell the screen does not even move on the 1st level. 

You have my money already but if other franchises come out, I will pass if this the direction you are going. Good work though if the purpose was to be completely different from other levels and giving the user no clue what the objective is.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="120">
    <text>I suggest that the next angry bird be angry birds &quot;lord of the rings.&quot;love this game,can't stop thinking about it!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="121">
    <text>Even after buying the 'full' version you still get ads for other angry birds games.  And even after paying real life money to unlock the eagle, you can only use it every so often.  This is a wonderful example of what is wrong with apps for iPhone in general.  I got duped into giving them some money, hopefully someone in the future will be dissuaded by this.  Rovio is an awful money grabbing company and knowing what I know now I will never give them another cent.  I encourage all to follow suit.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="122">
    <text>I thought I loved 'Angry Birds' before the update, but the mad scientist lab is incredible. Takes me back to playing the game for the first time and it was just plain ole' fun. You guys have totally outdone yourselves with the adorable scenery and characters. More please... (PS- no offense but I was getting bored with the SW series)</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="123">
    <text>I'm always looking forward to Angry Birds updates but this last one is awful. Red feathers flying around telling you what to hit-it doesn't even feel like Angry Birds anymore. Please go back to levels like in the beginning. You are ruining this super fun game!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="124">
    <text>This is awsome</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="125">
    <text>The games pretty good. But now every time I go to this app it automatically goes home, so now I can't even play. It was fun but now it's just taking up space.</text>

    <text>Here's my review for Red's Mighty (Crappy) Feathers: it's just not fun. I lost interest quickly. I hope Rovio sees all these 1 star reviews and takes them to heart. Rovio, please go back to what you're good at!</text>

  <sentence id="157">
    <text>People are complaining about the new update of Angry Birds. It's just an ADDITION of levels to the original game with a twist, and it's NOT that bad. Sure, it's different from the previous levels, but it's unique and could get a bit challenging if you play the whole thing instead of just playing two levels and saying it's horrible. I'm sure there will be more levels of the same classic Angry Birds coming soon, so all the complainers need to take a seat and be patient. Great job on the game, Rovio! And for all who don't have the game, don't let these reviews prevent you from getting it. You don't have an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch unless Angry Birds is on it.

P.S. I don't work for Rovio or anything, F.Y.I.</text>

    <text>Angry Birds rock! But the Toons are so great there should be a different app for it. I would honestly be willing to pay for an Angry Birds Toons app for one or two dollars set up exactly how it is set up on the Angry Birds app or a little different as long as it's not confusing. I love Red and Chuck. More Angry Bird Toon videos with them please. 5 stars easy!! GET THIS GAME!!! Mighty eagle rocks too.(:</text>

  <sentence id="162">
    <text>Big complaints about it. 1) bird doesn't seem to go where I click, but rather in the general direction of the pig...extremely annoying. 2) the extremely slow speed that the birds reload. 3) at the beginning of level the extremely slow speed that I'm given control (I'm swiping to get to the bird, but no response). If the first two are fixed, then I'd give it 4 stars.</text>

  <sentence id="163">
    <text>I don't see what all the hype is about. Really kind of dumb. Throw birds at buildings to kill pigs.. Nintendo has better games for casual gamers. If you want a really great game on the App Store check out infinity blade, Tiny, Tower, Warzone: Anomaly, Eufloria, or anything by Telltale Games. Kairosoft makes pretty fun and cute games, too.</text>

    <text>Once, I wrote a good review for this app. I am now realizing how dumb I was. This app is like giving a dead body plastic surgery before its burial, with the surgery prolonging the burial. I can not wait until the Angry Birds fad ends. It has been around for 3+ years and all they ever add is 15 levels every three months or so to milk the franchise. END IT PLEASE! To conclude... I wish to bash all of the five-star reviewers over their heads with various pottery.</text>

    <text>Just like everything else in life. You pays sometimes then it turns out free.  I'm fine with that. Really. 

What I DON'T like is that ridiculous Game Center garbage. I don't compete with friends. I don't need to see a leader board. I can't STAND having to go through that stupid thing every couple days to disable it when I already did that. 

There should be an option to turn off Game Center permanently. Not everyone wants that. 

Absolutely ridiculous. I don't mind turning it off. ONCE. 

Game is awesome, addicting and plays flawlessly. Worth 6 stars but only giving one until they stop that Game Center crap.</text>

    <text>The game crashed and deleted all my progress. The update is otherwise good -- not great. There are still tower defense levels on my phone. I hate tower defense games.

    <text>I like the game and there always seem to be more levels than I have time to master. This game is heavily marketed to kids - fine by me, my kid loves the blankets and bath towels and t-shirts - but they've added videos to the app you can't turn off anywhere in the settings. I don't want my kid idly watching cartoons, I don't mind playing games. Give us the ability to turn off cartoons some way other than putting the iPod into airplane mode! He has learning apps that need the network, which makes this app a pain for me.</text>

    <text>It was free for 1 day! So what if you paid for it. It's only a $0.99 app. I bought this a long time ago &amp; I'm not complaining. I think it's cool it was free for a little bit. It's a great game. It's not like they made Angry Birds Star Wars free. (If you like this game &amp; it's your first &amp; only angry birds. You should get Angry Birds Space.) It's almost better in my opinion. :)</text>

    <text>This isn't a new level, it's a totally new game. The concept is completely different and takes any fun out of Angry Birds.

    <text>This is a fun game and for 99 cents is very entertaining.  However, as you get further into the levels, it becomes pretty obvious that this game was written to keep you from progressing unless you spend hours doing the same pointless task until you succeed, or you pay more money to be allowed to progress with a reasonable effort.  Kind of takes the entertainment out of it.</text>

    <text>I've always been a big fan of the entire Angry Birds series. However, with the most recent updates to this particular game, there is a hugely frustrating glitch. On levels with the egg dropping birds, more often than not whenever I attempt to drop an egg the icons atop the screen interfere and the result is them trying to sell me an eagle rather than dropping the egg. I've talked to others who have had the same issue. I really thought that Rovio would be above such plebeian glitches by now.</text>

    <text>Angry birds is the best game of all time. Nothing can beat or ever will beat it. When it has those days when it's free DOWNLOAD IT. Still worth it for 99c though.

Again I love love love love LOVE this app.</text>

    <text>I have been playing Angry Birds for a while and love it. But the latest level just takes this game to a new level of low.

Honestly, was this designed for a group of semi-literate morons who need to be hand held through the game? 

Part of the fun is getting through a level only to find its good for one star and working to clear it to three. That's gone. There is no excitement here. 

Pass. The Angry Birds may have come home to roost.</text>

Still enjoy the black exploding birds - the finality they offer.
My aim is improving with a better ratio of 3 star efforts. Thanks for the fun!
You still preoccupy me happily! M
I had to give one level to the eagle and have been playing lots of solitaire to help recover. Now I am ready to go back and give it another try. The ability to pick up and retry gives the game yet another 5 stars.
Hi, my aim has improved as has my ability to figure out how to get 3 stars on most all levels. It is fun to get help from the characters with special powers when I am really stuck. However I do not get help unless I

    <text>This game is way better thank angry birds seasons I'm glad it's finally free this made my day</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="453">
    <text>This should have been introduced as an entirely new (but still crappy) game, rather than as a new &quot;level&quot; with no resemblance to the original formula.  Quit the love affair with the Bad Piggies machines and stick to the original concept.</text>

    <text>App of the week I installed this on my iPod. A week later it kept shutting down the game after one play... And sometimes it doesn't let me play other worlds! I'd rather get something else with my money.</text>

  <sentence id="457">
    <text>Angry Birds is an overall success but I found some things that were great and others that weren't. I didn't get this app to long ago but I had played it before on another electronic device. Here is a brief recap on what you can expect if your going from tablet to apple. 

The UPS

1. This version includes power ups that fire up your bird or rumble the pigs.
2. In this Angry Birds (AB) you have a new level inspired by &quot;Bad Piggies&quot;.
3. AB is the classic fun it has always been.

The DOWNS

1. On the tablet AB is free, but Apple charges $0.99 which is kind of unfair.
2. As well, on my tablet they would give you a free &quot;mighty eagle&quot; everyday but Apple didn't have that.
3. This had nothing to do with this AB, but on tablet HD cost $0.99 while Apple charges $2.00.

If this is your first ever view of Angry Birds I'd say this is worth it. 

Enjoy!</text>

    <text>GREAT, on the go game to play. Any time, anywhere</text>

  <sentence id="459">
    <text>Ok, so maybe the new mini game isn't a very big success, but Rovio is doing this because they're trying to appeal to a wider audience. They figured, since the game bad piggies was such a hit, they would incorporate more piggie vehicles in a fun mini game. Yes, I know, the levels for it aren't the best, and its hard as a rock to beat the last level, but its just an attempt to try something new. I'm still giving angry birds 3 stars, since my little brother loves this game so much, but please do better next time.                                            - Lawgamer411</text>

    <text>I loved AB. I play to improve my ranking even tho I know I'll never get to the highest score cuz of all the hacker/cheater scores. But this new version is just crap. I still play it, just not the latest v. 

ps: please don't ruin AB Seasons with a similar version.</text>

  <sentence id="461">
    <text>Same shots often yield different results. There's no skill involved. I have the nagging suspicion that the game is programmed to make you lose a lot so that you feel like it's addictive and you are improving.</text>

    <text>I &lt;3 Angry Birds!!! Don't stop making new versions!!!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="468">
    <text>I can't believe Rovio went to all this trouble to turn a perfectly fun and addicting game into a game that should just be thrown in the trash!!!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="469">
    <text>I have enjoyed this game for a few years now up until now. The introduction of ads has been quite annoying and has caused me to not want to play this game anymore. I paid for this game and I don't understand why I have to be subject to the interruptions of ads during my play. I'm officially not an angry bird fan anymore.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="470">
    <text>Some complain about the difficulty of that perfect hit, but that little bit of challenge and finding it is rather rewarding. I wouldn't want to 3 star everything right off the bat. I've spent a good bit of time on this game, and it's great! Looking forward to more levels. Not a huge fan of the update before last with the different gameplay style.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="471">
    <text>Best mobile game ever!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="472">
    <text>They miss the mark, literally. It is super frustrating because the aim is off. The bird never seems to go exactly where I want. Maybe the arrow is forcing auto aim or something but if the pig is in the middle of a contraption but there's some other weak point, like TNT then I want to aim at that. 

Right now it's essentially &quot;button mashing&quot; throwing as many birds in as fast as possible and hoping a few hit close to the mark. Of course the delays at the start of each level aren't helping either. Let me start attacking right away, don't let the pigs have a 5 second jump on me.</text>

  <sentence id="473">
    <text>I think the new idea for reds angry feather is great! It's more strategic and a lot of fun.</text>

  <sentence id="477">
    <text>I love the game. Great that I can move between iPhone and iPad without losing all of my hard work.  Wish I could do that in space and rio. Really hate the new leaderboard. Really hard to tell where I sit. Wish it would still show in vertical mode.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="478">
    <text>I used to love angry birds but after the new update whenever I try to play the new level the app stops altogether but it works fine for the rest of the levels rovio better fix this soon</text>

    <text>You took a great game that was challenging and ruined it with childish gimmicks. 

The power-ups are ridiculous and boring. Where is the fun in &quot;cheating&quot; 

I won't be playing anymore.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="491">
    <text>The excitement of a new update quickly turned to disappointment. This is not the game we have come to love. It's just not fun to play.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="492">
    <text>I absolutely cannot stand this game! I was addicted to the originals but DONE with this ridiculous game. Hope you come out with something new other than Star Wars SOON! Disappointed ):</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="493">
    <text>Cool</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="494">
    <text>This is the best game I have ever played but I think you should make something where you can make your own levels. That would make this game a lot more fun because once you complete the game there are more levels that you can play that aren't part of the campaign. That would be cool!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="495">
    <text>Crashes all the time!  I can't load the first level; it just shuts down!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="496">
    <text>Works ok with iPhone 4 and IOS6, but now crashes EVERY TIME on 1st Gen iPad running IOS5.1, so, as I said . . .</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="497">
    <text>Gotta disagree with all the haters. I love the newest update. Rovio took a risk by adding something fresh and different and it works great. It's a lot more challenging hitting a moving object rather then something stationary. I love seeing all of the piggies contraptions. I hope Rovio adds more levels to this new update and maybe include another bird besides Red Bird.</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="498">
    <text>I don't really like what angry birds looks like these days. Why can't it look like it did when it first came out? Couldn't Rovio just update the levels? Please bring back that look we had in version 1.5.2 in the next update. And update it soon. Or at least let us play on lower versions!!!!!!!</text>

You'll see many familiar faces from LOC and GS!  The UI takes a little getting used to if you're used to LOC and GS.  More active game play.  Use my invite ID 787854195 to receive a SR card.  See ya in the game!</text>

  <sentence id="500">
    <text>Wouldn't sync on 4G (data worked perfectly when using other apps). All progress was gone until I came home and logged back in to my Rovio account using my wifi, which means all my progress will be gone when I'm offline (on an airplane etc). A sure downside to the cloud functionality. I've already had to start from scratch many times when I'm playing on a new device.

One more thing, the original Angry Birds theme song is so much better than the new version. Bring it back!

Update: Thank you for bringing back the original theme song! Love it! I'm upgrading you to 4 stars!</text>
