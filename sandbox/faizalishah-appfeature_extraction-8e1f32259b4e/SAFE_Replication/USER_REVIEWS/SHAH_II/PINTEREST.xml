    <text>Don't attempt to edit your board description.	Apparently, when editing a long board description using this app, it erases everything on the right that you're not able to see.

    <text>Better than Tumblr! NEW RATING!	UPDATE: 2/3/14 Pinterest needs to not take up 50 MBS on my phone, I will be uninstalling this app soon if not changed,even if I love it.     Faster, easier , and more options to use. When Pinterest was introduced I thought it was stupid that they're trying to replace Tumblr because at that time it wasn't so slow and had not gone through the major face-lift yet. Anyway I'm not going to compare the two but  I got the App on my phone and have been addicted since. No more Tumblr for me anymore.</text>
