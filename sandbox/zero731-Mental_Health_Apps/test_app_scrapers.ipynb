Being able to choose a longer session so I don't have to keep restarting it. Prevent screen timeout does not work. My most critical comment is for the end of the session. The soothing voice is good throughout but when it's time to bring you back, the volume jumps up and throws off the whole vibe. So again I start over. Please fix it so maybe it gradually comes up or is the same volume as the breathing track. On a side note, I could get into Sleep Sounds- Empower your mind as one of the music tracks.\",\n",
