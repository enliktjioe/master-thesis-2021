A waste of money and time as they use covid as an excuse to delay responding to your glitches joining a scheduled session due to technical difficulties. After over 1 month of trying to actually schedule a meet with someone, I gave up and TS charged my insurance for 1 session therapist canceled last minute and stated they couldn’t do on their end nor could they give me a session back.

Either the guided meditation was lacking or the sound quality of the music/nature sounds was horrible. I found Calm and everything was great. I did the 7 day free trial and loved it. The $69/year subscription price is a bit of a sticker shock. (Everything is a subscription today and if you aren’t careful you can subscribe yourself into bankruptcy.) Fortunately they offered a discount that was low enough that I decided to give it a shot for a year. I have be using it pretty much daily for almost two months. There’s a guided meditation for just about any need. There’s high quality music and nature sounds are high quality and sound fantastic through my expensive IEMs. The sleep stories are a great feature. I feel like I am getting better sleep. All around the best app of it’s kind. \\n\\nNow to where it falls short. There’s no way to customize your user experience. It’s Calm’s way or no way. Yes their way is great and works well most of the time. They have playlist but there’s no way to customize them to meet my individual needs. This was a dealbreaker for me at $69/year so I’m not sure I will renew when my annual subscription is up. What would make this the perfect app would be to customize my sleep experience. I want to be able to create a custom playlist (or multiple custom playlist) to last throughout the night. Yes, I know that many of the music tracks are an hour long and you can set a sleep time that will repeat the track for hours but you are still repeating one track. I want the ability to start with a sleep story then have it play music the rest of the night. Maybe I want one track that will help me fall asleep, another track or 2 that will help me stay asleep and a track that is a little more upbeat to help me wake up refreshed. That should be something included in a subscription of this price. \\n\\nOne final “nice to have” would be profiles. The annual subscription price would be much easier to swallow if I could have a separate profile for myself, my wife and my kids each with our own playlist.</th>\n",

Never doing this app again. I got scammed, was very misleading and how was I supposed to know it was $1300, I would not have done it if I knew. This is why it gets one star.

Our body’s sympathetic system spikes when we run into danger. When we feel anxiety our body does the same. Calm music helps to increase our parasympathetic response which allows us to calm down.

       "I’m an over thinker. I get “analysis paralysis” - trying to figure out what’s “best” when making a decision... but stalling on actually doing it. So choosing to get counseling, much less acting on it - was a big deal. *Btw, that’s not why I was wanting counseling- I’m just being real here.  I’ve got all kinds of other fun things I wanted to address in my crazy world, that’s just a fun fact about myself that I’ve learned. :) \n",
       "So research:  I read tons of reviews on MANY different platforms, I googled the “best online counseling apps” too :) I called my doctors office for referrals... then once I chose BetterHelp, I second guessed spending the money - so I actually waited an extra week- knowing full well I’d blow that money on eating out or something dumb... when I really needed to take the time to take care of me and talk to someone.  \n",
       "So the following week I stopped putting it off, and I jumped in, and signed up and it was EASY. I checked the boxes so they could match me and what expertise I needed from my counselor.  Really easy stuff.  Not a long questionnaire that I might avoid in a waiting room... just me and my phone, on an app, on my couch, clicking away.  I was honest about my challenges and insecurities and checked all that pertained to me (even if it made me sound like a train wreck LOL) - and then the app said it would do the work... and while I waited the app suggested to just to maybe write a few paragraphs about where I was at right then... So I did- and pushed send. \n",
       "*And yes I did THOROUGHLY read how to cancel my subscription and/ or the ability to change counselors if it wasn’t working... and it sounded like they were totally open to change if I needed it and easy to cancel... plus I saw no alarming online trends of people posting how they were stuck in never ending fees due to contractual agreements, etc... so I told myself “it was just ONE CONVO” from home, on my phone, to see what it was like and I’d go from there. This app is legitimate with licensed professionals. Don’t let an app make you think it’s not “real counseling” - it’s 2020, you don’t have to be in the same room to get good counsel and a compassionate ear. :)\n",
       "Minutes later the app notified me that a counselor had been matched - for me to read her bio and maybe the reviews written for her and if I accepted, we’d move forward. I liked that feature - gave me some sense of control. So I did that, and then I pushed accept... because she DID sound experienced and qualified, a good match for me, and the reviews were well written, positive, and on point.\n",
       "I gotta admit, I was nervous- of the unknown, would she be a good fit? Words are easy to sell something, but the person is what matters... so I had nervous awkwardness, the “how do we talk when we’ve never met”, etc. but the simple fact is that I did ALL of this on my couch in under 30 min was a clear GIFT. \n",
       "We didn’t talk immediately, rather we texted back and forth via the app and she suggested I go to the schedule section and pick a time for a phone call a few days later. So I did.  \n",
       "I really liked that transition, and it helped my anxiety about it a bit. Like I wasn’t / couldn’t go into “denial mode” and forget I signed up for it... LOL ... but it DID give me a buffer time to not have to jump “ALL IN” right then when my moment of inspiration occurred - if that makes sense? Like the act of “signing up for counseling” officially would classify me as depressed or dysfunctional or something... texting was just a baby step, and THAT I could do.  Some reviews said they visited right then via phone or live feed “FaceTime” concept... but for me, this buffer really worked. It gave me a few days to process why I signed up and what was I hoping out of it. PLUS she kept in touch with a few notes or thoughts to my texts that I had sent her... it was really EASY and painless and non intrusive... like I was in charge and she was interested and compassionate to what worked for ME. It had been a while since I’d received that approach... so I kept communicating.\n",
       "I’m really thankful I did. I actually wish I had done it sooner - like way before.  It’s been a game changer for me.  \n",
       "My counselor Angela is such a great listener, and summarizes my thoughts so clearly it’s like she really understands my experiences, my history... she doesn’t expect too much, and yet always helps me find steps I can take till we speak again - which is invaluable. \n",
       "She touches base throughout the week with tips and encouragement and tangible actions if I’m up for it or just to think over... all of which are so helpful. \n",
       "She has a compassionate approach that is really a gift - and while we are early (a month) into our counseling relationship, I know I made the right decision to reach out for help.  \n",
       "Recently turning 50, we’re now empty nesters, and I’m making career changes too... I feel blessed that I was able to find the right fit for counsel - to help me process my past and also transition to the next chapter of my life.  \n",
       "I’m learning a bit more about me each day - but it’s not overwhelming. It’s not a magic wand to make things perfect in an instant, but it has offered me hope, comfort and encouragement that I needed... tangible but realistic steps to move forward each day, and has helped me to see how much possibility is still out there for me. \n",
       "It’s weird to stop and remember that you had big dreams before marriage and kids, and well... before life happened. Like a fog slightly clearing, or a chapter of a favorite book that’s long forgotten... you’ve dusted it off and are reading through... and you’re reminded how good you felt when reading it.  That’s what it’s like, and each day I lay that book down after reading a little, but now I don’t ignore it - or feel overwhelmed to reflect and read it... I’m actually curious and so I pick it up each day to remember more.\n",
       "If maybe your story is similar to mine, I’d encourage you to jump in and give it a try- I am truly thankful I did."
