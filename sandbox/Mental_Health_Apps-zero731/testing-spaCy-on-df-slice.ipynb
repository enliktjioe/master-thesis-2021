My first counselor seemed like a nice lady who I’m sure might be a good match for someone, but not for me. I told her many times in a variety of ways that my main struggle is with anxiety and self-motivation. The last two years of my life have been wasted on TV and video games and I’m struggling to get the desire to work on anything productive. When I told her that I’m worried about falling back into my unproductive routine once my husband returns to school and I’m home alone most days again, her best advice was that I would probably get so bored I would have to do something. If that were true the last two years I would’ve been very productive and I wouldn’t even need to be seeking help. I’m not just gonna magically become motivated due to boredom. I’ve switched to a new counselor who I’m hoping is a lot better, but this has so far proven to not be helpful.\\n\\nEDIT: My second counselor wasn’t much better. If she asked how I was doing and I said “I’m doing ok” she would immediately assume something was wrong even though I really was doing fine...then I’d have to come up with some reason I was “upset” which just made me focus on the negative things, which only made me feel worse. Then if I’d mention I’m having trouble getting motivated she’d say “just do it” but I could watch a Nike commercial for free and get that same advice. I will be cancelling my account soon.</th>\n",

I heard about BetterHelp.com from the \"Tiger Belly\" podcast and decided to try it after speaking with a friend who said therapy has helped him clear some of the anxiety he's built up over the past 15-20 years. As I'm approaching age 43, I was very self-aware of some of my flaws and fears but really couldnt come up with the best solution to controlling either one on my own.\\n\\nRight off the bat, signing up for BetterHelp was easy. The questionnaire was kind of fun and they assigned me a therapist which was fast. The therapist messaged me and asked some basic questions before we finally met for the first time via video conference. The first session was what I expected which was very broad and I was just answering more questions. By the 2nd appointment though, the therapist really started to connect some dots for me and its been very eye opening for myself to realize some of the things my therapist had pointed out. I'm now on my 6th session and its an interesting process to converse via video conference and unload some of my fears, angers and anxiety onto a professional who can analyze them and help me better understand myself and avoid losing focus on my main goals.\\n\\nMoving fwd, I may not need weekly appointments (bi-weekly seems better now that I have slightly more clarity) but I can always go back and schedule more if I choose. There's a journal feature on the site and iPhone app that allows you to type all your daily thoughts and experiences and share them with your therapist (you can also choose not to share as well). Its really a great app and extremely affordable. I've had a ton of friends sign up after hearing my experience as well. I encourage everyone to give it a try and see how it works for them...you also have the choice of changing therapists at anytime incase you arent comfortable with the one you're assigned.\\n\\nDive in and dont look back...its all for you and your mental health.</th>\n",

This was tedious and annoying and left room for lots of misinterpretation, as I had changed a lot in those 5 years. \\n\\nThe first therapist I was matched with was wonderful! Four weeks later, she told me she was leaving the platform. I was devastated. I asked BH to give me some free weeks and they did, they gave me 4. \\n\\nThe next therapist I found was awful. The one after that was just OK and didn’t seem to fully understand the rules around live chat sessions and cut some of my sessions short. By this time it had been another 3 weeks. I didn’t feel like spending more time and money gambling on finding yet another therapist and feeling even more unseen so I ended my subscription. \\n\\nI will say that BetterHelp is a solid company and provides good customer service.

It was conceived of and is led by a Neuroscientist. Not a spiritual leader or some sort of self-help guru. His background is in understanding the way the mind works in a scientific and practical way, so when I learned that he had an app to help people feel the benefits of meditation in their daily lives, I knew I had found the right app. \\n\\nThe price is a bit steep, I will admit that, but for me this was the only app that was really going to work because I’m familiar with some of Sam’s books and I felt like I could trust that he’s coming from a genuine place. They’re also very flexible on pricing if you’re having trouble affording the app, so the price barrier might not be as rigid as you expect. \\n\\nI’m 12 days into the introductory course, and while I know I still have a long way to go (it’s like learning a language) I feel like I’m already starting to see little glimpses of eureka moments, as tenuous as they may be at this early stage. There are fifty 10-minute guided meditations to go through before the app really opens up with all kinds of other meditation practices (you can skip ahead but I choose not too), and the fact that I feel like I’m already rounding some sort of corner in my understanding of what meditation really is has me truly excited and committed to seeing this journey through to a lifetime of practice and insight. \\n\\nI believe you can start with any meditation right from the outset, but if you’re a beginner like me it’s recommended to go through the intro course first, which is what I’m doing. I want to build a strong foundation and grasp the basics as well as I can before I try anything more complex. \\n\\nOne really nice feature are all of the extra content that comes with the app that is beneficial in its own right, like interviews with interesting people or short podcast-like talks that really have a lot of useful information and make a great companion to the actual meditation practice. You can go at your own pace, but I’ve found that one lesson each morning before I start my day seems to be a comfortable pace for me. Sometimes I want to keep going because I’m genuinely enjoying the process, but I want to make sure I’m absorbing the basics well and I’m not the quickest learner, so a lesson per day seems to be just right. \\n\\nNo review would be complete without some sort of negative aspect, and for me the only thing I can really see at the moment is the price and the barrier that it might throw up in front of potential customers. I think a month long free trial could help sway some people who may be on the fence about it or who aren’t sure if meditation is right for them. I’m not going to let the relatively steep price affect my rating however, because I feel like that’s not really a ding on the app itself. It’s a premium product, like shopping at a local organic grocery store vs Walmart, or buying an Apple laptop over a Lenovo PC. You get what you pay for. Only in this case you’re investing in yourself more so than the actual product, you’re allowing the developers to keep providing this resource for you, and you’re paying for access to this new healthier, happier version of yourself. How is that not a worthy investment?</th>\n",

It doesn’t rush you at all, instead it gives you all the time u want, it helped me mentally tbh more which is more important to me atm. I would definitely recommend this app especially if u wanna set yourself a routine for each day. I only have 1 comment, I just really wish we can add our own habits/tasks/goals! And if possible, I can make every day a new task or goal come up, so it wouldn’t be the same routine every single day :) everything else is prefect tbh and definitely helps u as any beginner! 95% recommended ;)</th>\n",
