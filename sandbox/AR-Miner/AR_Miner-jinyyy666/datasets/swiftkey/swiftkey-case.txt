1	1352958964956	5	lenthirteen ratingfive my most used app makes typing so much easier and faster great app
2	1352958897972	1	lentwelve ratingone stopped working again, unable to download language packs, despite already being downloaded.
3	1352957566426	1	lenfour ratingone crashes chrome every 5 minutes.
4	1352957566426	1	lenfive ratingone using an epic 4g touch with cm10.
5	1352955608475	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i love it but i just wish it had a going down button but it's still the best keyboard i've ever had
6	1352955094256	5	lentwelve ratingfive this app is great works fast and accuracy is great worth buying.
7	1352954424225	5	lenthree ratingfive love this product.
8	1352954424225	5	lenfifteen ratingfive samsung's default keyboard was too slow to keep up with my fast/rapid typing!
9	1352954424225	5	leneleven ratingfive this one keeps up with it and has better correction ability!
10	1352952465881	5	leneleven ratingfive but i said to hell with it and downloaded the keyboard.
11	1352952465881	5	lenseven ratingfive i love it on my note ii.
12	1352951025709	5	lenfour ratingfive love it since day 1
13	1352949357712	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this is a very awesome keyboard with very accurate prediction, i love it very much.
14	1352949357712	5	lennine ratingfive but please add chinese language support, really need it.
15	1352948690168	4	lensixteen ratingfour so when are we getting the new features like the ones for the android key board?
16	1352946229792	4	lennine ratingfour really like the keyboard and bought the full version.
17	1352946229792	4	lensix ratingfour it is so close to perfect.
18	1352946229792	4	lenfourteen ratingfour when in horizontal view you can't see any of the other persons messages.
19	1352946229792	4	lensixteen ratingfour i even changed the layout to small to give more room but still won't show.
20	1352946229792	4	lentwelve ratingfour it's pointless to even go horizontal if you can read anything.
21	1352944063746	5	lensix ratingfive simple,  quick key response,  work great!
22	1352942844682	5	lenfive ratingfive huge improvements over the years.
23	1352942352085	4	lenfive ratingfour i really like this keyboard!
24	1352941114015	5	lentwelve ratingfive after coming from an iphone i was ready to send my s3 back.
25	1352941114015	5	lenfive ratingfive the default keyboard is horrific.
26	1352941114015	5	lenfour ratingfive this is absolutely amazing.
27	1352941114015	5	lenten ratingfive similar to how the iphone works and i love it.
28	1352939746002	5	lennine ratingfive .feature, recently announced but still hands down the best.
29	1352939746002	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive the fact that this is #1 in the play store should send a loud message to google and device manufacturers that their keyboards are lacking.
30	1352938269381	1	lensix ratingone no word prediction in various browsers.
31	1352938269381	1	lenthree ratingone makes no sense.
32	1352938269381	1	lenfive ratingone no dedicated # row option either.
33	1352938269381	1	leneight ratingone company could care less about adding real functionality.
34	1352938269381	1	lensixteen ratingone feature requests for real functionality sit and collect dust while fluff skinning type ones get done.
35	1352938269381	1	leneight ratingone thank god i got it for a dime.
36	1352936231676	3	lenfive ratingthree i'd like japanese added.
37	1352936231676	3	leneight ratingthree i'd be happier with the purchase then.
38	1352936014681	5	lenfive ratingfive best keyboard on the market!
39	1352930183118	5	lentwentysix ratingfive by far the best keyboard app ever,  i definitely recommend getting this app, it will change your whole experience with texting, typing, etc.   buy this app!
40	1352928907349	5	lennineteen ratingfive a must have if you're upgrading from a phone w/ a slide out keyboard to a touch screen!
41	1352928907349	5	lentwenty ratingfive trial version expired & i've had no word prediction - typing in every last letter, hyphen, quotation mark, you name it.
42	1352928907349	5	lenfour ratingfive will drive you crazy!
43	1352928907349	5	lenten ratingfive just wait until the trial expires; you'll be upgrading.
44	1352928907349	5	leneleven ratingfive thanks for the trial & not making us decide based on reviews.
45	1352928783386	5	leneighteen ratingfive don't get me wrong, this app is a lifesaver and i have recommended it to many friends.
46	1352928783386	5	lenfive ratingfive i humbly propose some suggestions: 1.
47	1352928783386	5	lentwelve ratingfive for the semicolon (;) and colon (:), it does not automatically delete the "space"
48	1352928783386	5	lennine ratingfive prior like it does for the comma and period.
49	1352928783386	5	lenthirty ratingfive this is important, because if i want it to autocorrect the prior word, i need to press space to accept the suggestion, and the space also adds an actual space.
50	1352928783386	5	leneight ratingfive eg. shulf  -> shield    requires me to press space.
51	1352928783386	5	lentwelve ratingfive and when i do that, it fixes it and adds a space.
52	1352928783386	5	lentwentysix ratingfive but if i want to type a colon or semicolon after it, i have to delete the space just added and then hold the appropriate key.
53	1352928783386	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive the quotation marks (") point in a particular direction, meaning that they are the same both at the beginning or at the end of a quote.
54	1352928783386	5	lenfortynine ratingfive there are two ways to fix this, as i see it: (1) have the keyboard automatically put in the forward facing quotes if they come before a word ("likethis) and backwards facing at the end of a word (likethis"), or (2) use neutral quotes that just go straight up and down.
55	1352928783386	5	lensix ratingfive thanks for a fantastic app, though.
56	1352926744203	1	lennineteen ratingone every time i restart my note 2 (at&t) i have to re select swift key again to use it.
57	1352925589300	5	lensix ratingfive i now have a pink keyboard!
58	1352925589300	5	lennineteen ratingfive so much easier than my old i phone keypad  and it is a pleasure to use on my galaxy 2.
59	1352925589300	5	lensixteen ratingfive if only i could now find an app to change my black background on my emails!
60	1352924319310	5	leneight ratingfive first time i've ever purchased an app.
61	1352924319310	5	lenthirteen ratingfive after the trial ran out i couldn't imagine going on without swiftkey.
62	1352924319310	5	lenfive ratingfive thanks for a great keyboard!
63	1352923250834	5	lentwo ratingfive 94 percent amazing.
64	1352921314512	5	lentwentysix ratingfive never thought i would need a replacement keyboard app but when i got my galaxy s iii, the native keyboard was not working well for me.
65	1352921314512	5	lenfive ratingfive this one just makes sense.
66	1351774439997	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i have tryed out many others but no one is like this one!
67	1351773514878	1	lennine ratingone i have emailed this company 3 times without a response!
68	1351770385892	3	lennine ratingthree less responsive since last update and crashes phone often.
69	1351770385892	3	lenseven ratingthree this is even after wiping my phone.
70	1351770385892	3	lentwelve ratingthree it can't spell or auto-correct correctly when writing in caps.
71	1351770385892	3	leneleven ratingthree still worth 3 stars because it's great in all other ways.
72	1351769787353	4	lentwentyone ratingfour one if the best keyboards ive used but the screen on my phone is way to sensitive    samsung galaxy ace plus s7500
73	1351767944309	1	lennine ratingone the auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous.
74	1351767944309	1	lenseven ratingone allow the option to turn it off.
75	1351761139987	3	lenseven ratingthree i've had enough of this keyboard.
76	1351761139987	3	lenten ratingthree trying to type a username and the autocorrect changes it.
77	1351761139987	3	lentwentyone ratingthree i shouldn't have to do extra for it not to do this so i've gone back to using stock.
78	1351757706815	5	leneleven ratingfive i was skeptical at first but this app is truly amazing.
79	1351757706815	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i don't think i could ever go back to the stock android keyboard.
80	1351752891070	4	lenten ratingfour aber das ganze macht das handy doch unn?tig lahm.
81	1351752891070	4	lenthree ratingfour frisst immer runde 40-50mb
82	1351749022743	5	lenfour ratingfive super efficient and awesome :)
83	1351747029720	5	leneleven ratingfive nothing to add really, wish tablet version wasn't separate purchase.
84	1351744051002	5	lenseven ratingfive predicts very well and reduces incorrect keys.
85	1351744051002	5	lenseven ratingfive my typing is much faster as well.
86	1351744051002	5	lensix ratingfive i noticed the difference right away!
87	1351743343202	5	lenthirteen ratingfive by far the most useful and rewarding app i have installed to date.
88	1351743343202	5	lentwentyone ratingfive at this point i'm essentially flinging my thumbs at my phone as fast as possible, and meaningful sentences come out.
89	1351743343202	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive the first few weeks were a bit tough while swiftkey was still learning my style, but after that it's a breeze.
90	1351742678888	5	lenfive ratingfive how about a character counter.
91	1351742678888	5	lenthirty ratingfive when i am writing on some apps that limit characters, such as a status update, i can't see how much i have put in without hitting the back button.
92	1351742678888	5	lenfourteen ratingfive you could add a character count on the right above/below the send button.
93	1351741170172	3	lenten ratingthree i am vietnamese and i want to type my language.
94	1351741170172	3	lenfour ratingthree is it coming soon?
95	1351739316767	5	leneight ratingfive this app makes phone usage an amazing experience.
96	1351739316767	5	lenfour ratingfive works like a dream!
97	1351738880307	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i used to use swype thinking it was the fastest keyboard out there with some ok predictability.
98	1351738880307	5	leneight ratingfive i tried this app out and loved it.
99	1351738880307	5	lentwelve ratingfive i can't type on my phone without this great predictive keyboard.
100	1351738880307	5	lensixteen ratingfive i left my phone at home the other day and was using my friends android phone.
101	1351738880307	5	lenten ratingfive the stock android keyboard is nothing compared to swift key.
102	1351737794027	1	lenseventeen ratingone great prediction and all, but as the title says, keeps deleting words if i type too fast.
103	1351737794027	1	lenfifteen ratingone what's the point in creating a great keyboard if typing fast brings about bugs?
104	1351737794027	1	leneleven ratingone give option to disable swipe back to delete word at least.
105	1351735749233	5	leneighteen ratingfive the number keys should be able to be customized if you want them as a row on top.
106	1351735749233	5	lenfive ratingfive still a 5 star app though.
107	1351735749233	5	lensix ratingfive on my way to 100000 keystrokes saved!
108	1351735392864	5	leneleven ratingfive i have for the past year been using smart keyboard pro.
109	1351735392864	5	lennineteen ratingfive it has only been a half a day and swiftkey by far surpasses my old keyboard and stock keyboard.
110	1351735392864	5	lennine ratingfive it blends well with ice cream sandwich operating system.
111	1351735392864	5	lennine ratingfive auto text including voice text is working nearly perfect.
112	1351734180909	5	lennine ratingfive better if it can also learn from whatsapp conversions
113	1351723623013	5	lenfive ratingfive i love the auto correct.
114	1351723623013	5	lennine ratingfive i wish it would let me add custom words.
115	1351719318635	3	leneleven ratingthree seems like it won't stay the default keyboard on jellybean.
116	1351716948062	5	lentwo ratingfive asus nexus
117	1351715391171	5	lenfourteen ratingfive no matter how fast i type it predicts what i'm trying to say
118	1351714770465	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this app is fackin amazing i must admit i hardly av to type :p
119	1351713975437	5	lennine ratingfive nice app to use instead of the standard keyboard.
120	1351713975437	5	leneight ratingfive spares you a lot of grey hairs :d
121	1351713858749	5	leneighteen ratingfive if you text very often, you should have this application, you can write in a very short time
122	1351713162498	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive this keyboard has just the right amount of customization, i can change the height of the keyboard and the themes that come along with it look gorgeous on my super amoled screen.
123	1351713162498	5	lennine ratingfive its predictions are always accurate for the most part.
124	1351713162498	5	lenseven ratingfive and the new space feature is great!
125	1351713162498	5	lentwelve ratingfive had the demo trial and it was decent this is even better.
126	1351713162498	5	lenthree ratingfive totally worth the $4.
127	1350909056369	5	lenfour ratingfive very fast and easy.
128	1350909056369	5	lenseven ratingfive predictive text tends to be spot on.
129	1350908713066	5	lensixteen ratingfive the most amazing keyboard i've used ever, and i've used windows mobile for ages.
130	1350907698657	4	leneleven ratingfour a good keyboard dbhas an uncanny ability to predict next words.
131	1350907698657	4	lenten ratingfour the only thing missing is a swipe kind of input.
132	1350907698657	4	lenseven ratingfour hopefully it will come in the future.
133	1350903447846	4	lenseven ratingfour one of the better investment i made.
134	1350903447846	4	lentwenty ratingfour but needed to have a shortcut key to switch back to stock keyboard so i can typo chinese on my s3
135	1350902039128	1	leneight ratingone lacks even the most essential words in danish!
136	1350902039128	1	lenfive ratingone that just makes it unusable.
137	1350901011913	5	lenthree ratingfive very impressive indeed.
138	1350901011913	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommended.
139	1350898475787	5	lenthree ratingfive highly customisable & adaptive.
140	1350898475787	5	lennine ratingfive the way it suggests words and phrases is fantastic.
141	1350898475787	5	lenten ratingfive infinitely better than android's out-of-the-box keyboards.
142	1350898379050	5	lenfour ratingfive crazy fast and accurate
143	1350894729103	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i can type on this just as i could type on my blackberry.
144	1350894729103	5	lenfour ratingfive nearly same speed too.
145	1350889282350	5	leneight ratingfive found the stock keyboard on my s3 to suck.
146	1350888064373	5	lenfive ratingfive easily the best keyboard app.
147	1350886985997	2	lensix ratingtwo spent the money on this, sadly.
148	1350886985997	2	lentwentyeight ratingtwo but it adds a space after every punctuation, so it makes it nearly useless if you're picky like me or need to type email address a lot.
149	1350886985997	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo until they fix this or add an option to disable it, there are better keyboards.
150	1350885977341	3	lentwentyeight ratingthree don't like that some customization options aren't there and that common long press punctuation isn't on the main keyboard, but it's pretty good overall
151	1350885380485	4	lenseven ratingfour wish they had some better looking themes
152	1350883967350	5	leneight ratingfive truly does what the ad says it do.
153	1350883967350	5	lenseventeen ratingfive perfectly fits your each touch on the keys and knows what word you're about to say!
154	1350880933697	5	lenten ratingfive first appeared i have ever bought, it is that good.
155	1350878492401	5	lenseven ratingfive stock android keyboard already beat ios' easily.
156	1350878492401	5	lenfourteen ratingfive (with gesture typing etc)  even tho swiftkey doesn't have that gesture typing feature.
157	1350878492401	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it is king of any features that any sms app has out there.
158	1350878003873	4	lensix ratingfour this app is missing one thing.
159	1350878003873	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour emoji all my friends have it on there i phones and i'm missing out on the experience of using it in creative ways
160	1350877804205	5	leneleven ratingfive his input ape is the best keyboard i have ever had.
161	1350877804205	5	lentwentysix ratingfive it is so amazing you just might find yourself texting and sending emails just for the simple fact that is so so so easy and fun.
162	1350877804205	5	leneight ratingfive great job swift key team kudos to you.!
163	1350875822830	5	lentwentyone ratingfive here's any idea you guys should come out with different key board themes for each holiday like if you agree
164	1350874263296	5	lenten ratingfive i like swype but the space bar is too small.
165	1350874263296	5	leneighteen ratingfive i switch to it when i know i'm going to do a lot of one handed typing.
166	1350874263296	5	lenten ratingfive i have tried thumb but swift is the current champ.
167	1350874123706	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive i got my galaxy s3 recently and was worried about not having a physical keyboard, and but with this app, my typing speed and accuracy is almost same as having a physical keyboard!
168	1350874123706	5	lenseven ratingfive no more frustration and bunch of typos.
169	1350874123706	5	lennine ratingfive not much customizations but i'm ok with that.
170	1350872541826	5	lennineteen ratingfive swiftkey can finish your words, make predictions and know what you're typing even without hitting the scape bar.
171	1350872541826	5	leneight ratingfive this is simply the best keyboard for android.
172	1350871096442	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i would like if predictions worked when typing urls into the browser on the gs3.
173	1350870860961	5	lenseven ratingfive i love this app best keyboard ever.
174	1350870860961	5	lenfiftyone ratingfive i noticed a lot of complaints about it not having a customized dictionary, it does all you have to do is high light the word you want to add and click on it a drop down menu will appear from there click add to dictionary you can remove things as well
175	1350869150191	5	lenfifteen ratingfive love the keyboards just wish i could change typing sounds other than that great app!
176	1350993406076	4	lentwentythree ratingfour needs swype,  sometimes doubles on letters, hate the fact that a space automatically equals a period but overall very impressive and worth my $
177	1350992966110	5	lensix ratingfive only thing missing is welsh lang.
178	1350992966110	5	lenfour ratingfive basque, catalan, galician, icelandic.
179	1350992966110	5	lenten ratingfive many use a combination of welsh and eng in sentences
180	1350986658102	4	leneleven ratingfour it's nice and perfect, but still has 2 problem to choose; 1.
181	1350986658102	4	lensix ratingfour still hasn't pashto language support.
182	1350986658102	4	lenthirteen ratingfour it's limited for 3 languages to same time in language and layout option.
183	1350986658102	4	leneleven ratingfour it makes difficulty for those who are using more than 3 languages.
184	1350986658102	4	leneleven ratingfour if it updated, probably would be the best keyboard for android.
185	1350986658102	4	lenfive ratingfour we r waiting for 5.thanks.
186	1350984545330	5	lennineteen ratingfive hard to go back to the default keyboard after using this, and finally made me appreciate touch screen typing.
187	1350981619238	5	lensixteen ratingfive i have never experienced such speed on a cellphone in my life before i tried swiftkey.
188	1350981619238	5	lentwenty ratingfive it's prediction is borderline frightening with it's accuracy and it's like it's tapped into my mind.
189	1350981619238	5	lensixteen ratingfive sometimes i just stop trying and hit in rough estimations, and it still pulls it off.
190	1350981619238	5	leneighteen ratingfive it's amazing and it will change your life if you text a lot or use twitter frequently.
191	1350981619238	5	lentwelve ratingfive just now i tried out writing something really dumb to get "repair"
192	1350981619238	5	lenten ratingfive and it autocorrected me from twpauf :p it knows me!
193	1350981619238	5	leneight ratingfive try out swiftkey, you won't regret it!
194	1350977773591	5	lenfive ratingfive 100x better than  the default keyboard
195	1350976002294	5	leneleven ratingfive without this i can't text for the life of me.
196	1350976002294	5	lenfifteen ratingfive best app, they should just give it to you when you buy any android phone.
197	1350974508849	1	lenfive ratingone add jelly bean emoji support!
198	1350969261961	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive since updating to the latest android on my samsung nexus s, no matter how many times i switch the keyboard to swift key my phone keeps defaulting back to the standard keyboard.
199	1350969107982	4	lentwelve ratingfour i would like it more if it has tailoring for whatsapp chats!
200	1350968424929	5	lentwentyone ratingfive the update killed it on my thunderbolt. :( it says its turned on but i only get factory keyboard when i type
201	1350967389635	4	lenfive ratingfour add more keyboard skins please!
202	1350967389635	4	lenfive ratingfour other then that great app!
203	1350966848492	5	lennine ratingfive accurate predictions, customizable, easy to set up, visually appealing.
204	1350966848492	5	lentwentysix ratingfive makes typing on a touchscreen so great because i hateee it (even though i have a s3 haha) first app i bought, no regrets as of now.
205	1350966848492	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive for some reason, i can't finish the install but the keyboard works fine but i think it's because it saved my setting from when i used the trial version.
206	1350966848492	5	leneighteen ratingfive i just wish they had more language options like japanese and chinese, which i hope will come soon.
207	1350966848492	5	lenseven ratingfive more keyboard themes would be nice too!
208	1350965424316	4	lenseven ratingfour i would like japanese support as well.
209	1350964910783	2	lensix ratingtwo the predictions wow me every time.
210	1350964910783	2	lentwentyseven ratingtwo at first i was skeptical even though i'd seen this app on the market for quite some, but i was hooked once i used the trial.
211	1350964910783	2	leneight ratingtwo definitely try it, it's worth your time.
212	1350964910783	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo update: so many issues with chrome that have been acknowledged but not fixed.
213	1350962660331	5	leneighteen ratingfive useful, convenient, such a nice keyboard but hope there will be more language such as chinese or japanese.
214	1350957857884	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour i know you won't see this, but please please please make an option to take off the pop up letters on each key press.
215	1350957857884	4	lennine ratingfour i can text so much faster with out it.
216	1350956347379	5	lenten ratingfive i have been using it for a long time now.
217	1350956347379	5	lenseventeen ratingfive it's awesome works the best on t-mobile gs2 i can't use any other keyboard now.
218	1350956347379	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive i'm so used to slide to delete function that even if i try to use another keyboard i'll be swiping it to delete words lol.
219	1350956347379	5	lenten ratingfive i'm hoping we are getting some new good themes!
220	1350956201706	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i was so frustrated with the keyboard options that came with my phone.
221	1350956201706	4	lenten ratingfour after trying several apps this one is the absolute best!
222	1350956201706	4	lensix ratingfour i even purchased the full version :-)
223	1350953904969	5	lenfive ratingfive this keyboard is simply amazing.
224	1350953904969	5	leneighteen ratingfive text prediction is better than any other 3rd party keyboard available (and i've tried more than a few).
225	1350953904969	5	lenten ratingfive this is the only keyboard that kept me coming back.
226	1350953904969	5	lenfourteen ratingfive the only qualm i have with it is the layout of the secondary keys.
227	1350953904969	5	lentwentynine ratingfive why they decided to put numbers on the left side and symbols on the right is beyond me (rather than numbers along the top and symbols on the rest).
228	1350952024287	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i've tried quite a few different keyboard apps and this one is the best.
229	1350952024287	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive i love the size of the keys, the spacing between keys, and the app's ability to predict text and correct spelling and spacing errors as you go.
230	1350952024287	5	lensixteen ratingfive it also has been offering more personalization options in terms of colors etc. two thumbs up!
231	1350951003435	5	lentwo ratingfive cool app
232	1350944201466	2	lenten ratingtwo the latest update causes chrome to constantly crash on the s2.
233	1350944201466	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo had to stop using this keyboard because it's made browsing impossibly slow and frustrating.
234	1350944201466	2	lensix ratingtwo shame, it was my favourite keyboard.
235	1350943891267	5	lenten ratingfive i'm searching for a keyboard like this for years.
236	1350943891267	5	lenseven ratingfive every android user most have this keyboard.
237	1350943891267	5	lensix ratingfive you guys do the best job.
238	1350943891267	5	lenten ratingfive kudos for this lesson of how a keyboard must be.
239	1350943891267	5	lennineteen ratingfive every body start downloading this keyboard and pay for it and help this guys continuing developing this awesome product!
240	1350943891267	5	leneight ratingfive i use the spanish dictionary more than english.
241	1350943891267	5	lentwo ratingfive simply awesome!
242	1350943891267	5	lensix ratingfive please continue develop the spanish language.
243	1350941746872	3	lennineteen ratingthree on occasion, the words selection bar doesn't appear and the letters typed are not accepted by the application.
244	1351082530767	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i haven't found a better one and i truly doubt a better one exists out there.
245	1351081243784	5	leneight ratingfive unable to loan the bahasa melayu language pack.
246	1351079983295	1	lenseven ratingone omg this sucks compared to smart keyboard.
247	1351079983295	1	lenten ratingone used swiftkey for 3 weeks and i found so many bugs!
248	1351079983295	1	lenfive ratingone developer never answered my mails.
249	1351079076148	5	lentwo ratingfive love swiftkey!
250	1351079076148	5	lentwelve ratingfive i have one problem that just appeared over the last few days.
251	1351079076148	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive when i reboot my phone (nexus s) the stock android keyboard is the default one, so i have to go back to the settings to make swiftkey the default keyboard again.
252	1351079076148	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i tried to uninstall it and reinstalling it, but it still does the same.
253	1351079076148	5	lennine ratingfive edit: since updating to jelly bean 4.1.2, no more problem.
254	1351077961036	4	lenfourteen ratingfour this is by far the best keyboard you can use on an android phone.
255	1351077961036	4	leneight ratingfour only wish its tablet counterpart were as intuitive.
256	1351077961036	4	lenthirtytwo ratingfour probably not swiftkey's fault, but it there is a new bug on my nexus s 4g with jellybean: when the device restarts, it forgets all about swiftkey and resets to default keyboard.
257	1351077961036	4	lenfifteen ratingfour just something to watch out for and another reason to keep the cord handy lol
258	1351075049405	5	lentwo ratingfive absolutely brilliant
259	1351074233870	5	leneighteen ratingfive was great when first purchased but following an update it no longer works on my htc desire hd.
260	1351068254350	5	lenfive ratingfive love using it every day.
261	1351068254350	5	lenfour ratingfive its prediction is amazing.
262	1351066243360	3	lentwelve ratingthree this keyboard uses 54mb of ram as opposed to 9mb for the stock keyboard.
263	1351066243360	3	lenfive ratingthree makes your phone much slower.
264	1351066243360	3	lenfour ratingthree please fix horrible programming.
265	1351065391138	5	lenfour ratingfive save on rsi too!
266	1351064573031	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo everything looks okay but without chinese input is funny!.and no swype input?
267	1351063323624	3	lenthree ratingthree freezes a lot!
268	1351062644719	1	lenthirteen ratingone this didn't even work right and was a total waste of money.
269	1351059065394	4	lenthree ratingfour life changer app.
270	1351057404869	4	lensix ratingfour do you sp vietnamese lang thank
271	1351055871896	1	lentwelve ratingone can call or swift all they want bur it's no swype
272	1351055868422	3	lensixteen ratingthree it works well but there should be an option for adding custom words to the dictionary.
273	1351055868422	3	lennineteen ratingthree in addition, sometimes the suggested word list disappears until the keyboard is minimized and then brought back up again.
274	1351055868422	3	lentwentysix ratingthree this happens on both my galaxy nexus and nexus s and has been happening for the past year despite updates to the app and android os.
275	1351055796787	4	lennineteen ratingfour love how it works, themes are great, just wish that we could have our own personal dictionary in there.
276	1351055796787	4	lenfive ratingfour so close to being 5 stars!
277	1351052255378	4	lentwenty ratingfour please include an autotext feature, and change the arrow key to the top and it will be a perfect keyboard
278	1351047476638	4	lenseventeen ratingfour brilliant but doesn't offer suggestions in many situations, such as browser address bars and username fields.
279	1351047476638	4	lenten ratingfour otherwise perfect, although this is kind of a big deal.
280	1351046526864	5	lenfour ratingfive but needs more themes :/
281	1351041127091	5	lennineteen ratingfive i like how it vibrates, it makes it feel like you're pressing a button instead of a touchscreen.
282	1351041127091	5	lentwelve ratingfive also, it saves me a lot of typos and looks cool too.
283	1351041127091	5	lensixteen ratingfive sometimes though, it lags a little bit but apart from that, couldn't ask for more!
284	1351039919066	5	lensixteen ratingfive this app makes typing on my phone a joy and i can't recommend it enough.
285	1351039919066	5	lenfive ratingfive i buy this app immediately
286	1351037418941	5	lentwo ratingfive excellent keyboard!
287	1351037418941	5	lennine ratingfive this is much better than the original on my s3!
288	1351037418941	5	lenfive ratingfive well worth the four bucks!
289	1351036684151	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i tried the trial and this was simply the best keyboard i've ever used.
290	1351036684151	5	lentwelve ratingfive the trial period ended and i couldn't cope without buying it.
291	1351036607309	5	leneight ratingfive it's like it can read your mind.
292	1351036607309	5	lenthree ratingfive definitely recommend it.
293	1351034913919	5	lennine ratingfive works a lot better in ics than in gingerbread.
294	1351034913919	5	lentwenty ratingfive not recommended if you're still using gingerbread -- very sluggish and tends to miss keystrokes, as well as hog memory.
295	1351034913919	5	lennine ratingfive in ics, though, it's very responsive and fast.
296	1351029488145	5	lensix ratingfive makes my samsung nexus actually usable!
297	1351029212753	5	lenthirteen ratingfive what does it say about me that my favourite app is a keyboard?
298	1351029212753	5	lenfour ratingfive the app is phenomenal.
299	1351168863562	5	lenfour ratingfive great app, five stars
300	1351167187291	2	leneighteen ratingtwo i could not make full use of this app because it kept on saying "our servers are busy."
301	1351167187291	2	leneight ratingtwo i could not even personalize my writing style.
302	1351163213950	5	lensixteen ratingfive amazing app! , i have been using it for a long time, typing is easy and fast!
303	1351162213564	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo worked fine for a while, but some update broke it completely for me.
304	1351162213564	2	leneighteen ratingtwo my use case: type something and select one of the three suggestions on the top of the keyboard.
305	1351162213564	2	lennineteen ratingtwo in my scenario (three languages, de/en_us/he) this fails a lot (i think mostly with german words).
306	1351162213564	2	lennineteen ratingtwo type something, select the completion and the current text isn't replaced with the selected word, but removed entirely.
307	1351162213564	2	lennineteen ratingtwo combining multiple languages in one keyboard (one for de/en_us instead of two different) is crap as well.
308	1351161676335	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i use this on my samsung galaxy s3 with the voice recognition and it works brilliantly.
309	1351161676335	5	lenfourteen ratingfive the voice recognition has a about an 85-90% accuracy and this app fixes the remaining 10%.
310	1351161676335	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i'm guessing this app helps me write 3x -5x faster than what i normally would (along with all my corrections as prefer not to abbreviate).
311	1351161676335	5	lenfour ratingfive well worth the money.
312	1351161676335	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive i'm amazed how well it predicts what comes next (my friend says the app is reading my mind!), i'm guessing this type of app will be the future of typing on smart phones.
313	1351158618884	5	lenseven ratingfive easy to use and comparatively very fast.
314	1351158618884	5	lentwelve ratingfive if you do much typing, it is well worth the minimal expense.
315	1351154693304	4	lenfourteen ratingfour please add this feature, i'm texting a lot with whatsapp over sms/messaging.
316	1351154419741	3	lensix ratingthree please please support the 3x4 korean keypad.
317	1351154419741	3	lenthirteen ratingthree half the people here in seoul use the 3x4 and other half uses qwerty.
318	1351154419741	3	leneighteen ratingthree the only reason that i havent switched to swiftkey over the samsung keyboard is the lack of 3x4 keyboard.
319	1351154419741	3	lensixteen ratingthree admittedly swiftkey has great english support, but i need to be able to use both languages.
320	1351150544697	1	lensixteen ratingone the beta for thai version expired but there is no introduction of thai language in sight.
321	1351149983631	5	leneleven ratingfive need for themes!such as iphone theme and windows phone theme!
322	1351146726435	5	lenten ratingfive just purchased the app and i'm loving it already.
323	1351146726435	5	leneighteen ratingfive it's a relief since my phone is korean and i had trouble using spanish my native language.
324	1351146726435	5	lenthree ratingfive totally recommend this
325	1351146305657	4	lentwelve ratingfour 4 stars because no predictive text in web browser on jellybean galaxy s3 lte.
326	1351144439752	5	lenfive ratingfive i love the word prediction.
327	1351144439752	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i like the way it suggests words when you backspace to change a word.
328	1351144439752	5	lennine ratingfive the only issue i have is lack of themes.
329	1351144022339	5	lentwelve ratingfive i love swiftkey, and i only have had it for five minutes.
330	1351141941551	1	lenthirtythree ratingone when you are sending an email, if you are in the middle of a word fixing a typo and swiftkey is suggesting a word, sending the email will send with the word underlined.
331	1351141941551	1	lenten ratingone 1 star until fixed, i paid good money for this app.
332	1351140625232	3	lentwentyone ratingthree originally loved it, it's skipping around when i'm trying to use chrome and other apps, hopefully this gets fixed
333	1351139680851	4	leneight ratingfour can you please fix the lag with ics?
334	1351139680851	4	leneighteen ratingfour it was so smooth on gingerbread and i don't know what happened because no other keyboard lags.
335	1351139680851	4	lensixteen ratingfour i've tried everything out there and nothing comes close in prediction and ease of use.
336	1351139680851	4	lenfourteen ratingfour but because the other ones don't lag i'm using something else now.
337	1351139680851	4	lentwentyeight ratingfour i thought it was an ics problem but no other keyboard is lagging like this.i want to be back on swiftkey, please roll out a fix.please.
338	1351138591155	5	lenfour ratingfive awesome keyboard, very smart.
339	1351138591155	5	lenfifteen ratingfive one thing: enter key should work as space key, but also inserting a new line.
340	1351138591155	5	lennine ratingfive currently enter key does not commit best to match.
341	1351138591155	5	lenseven ratingfive for some reason, sometimes inserts a "dot"
342	1351138591155	5	lensix ratingfive "insert dot after pressing double space"
343	1351138591155	5	lenfive ratingfive mhh! :)  also, no japanese support!? .
344	1351136607909	4	lentwentyseven ratingfour love the keyboard and all its features, but i have not been able to bill my provider's acct for google play downloads ever since installing it.
345	1351136607909	4	lenfourteen ratingfour also not happy with the collection-of-data warning at the beginning of installation.
346	1351136607909	4	lenten ratingfour worried now that my credit card info has been stolen
347	1351134257983	1	lennineteen ratingone ***still can't save email addresses that have a '-' in them!*** also very laggy in landscape mode with gtalk.
348	1351131156960	5	lennine ratingfive had the trial version and upgraded to the next.
349	1351130296288	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive after having this app for a month, it has saved me a vast amount of time from correcting my errors with its intelligent auto corrector and word prediction.
350	1351130296288	5	lenten ratingfive i love this app and was recommended from a friend.
351	1351130296288	5	lenthree ratingfive worth the 5 stars
352	1351126277921	5	lenthree ratingfive best android keyboard
353	1351125636833	5	lensix ratingfive the predictive text works amazingly well.
354	1351125636833	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i also like the combination of multiple languages that use the same alphabet.
355	1351125044397	4	leneighteen ratingfour no if it could only play nice with google's chrome mobile browser.then it would be perfect!
356	1351125044397	4	leneighteen ratingfour but the cursor tends to jump around in the text box.so you end up quickly typing foolishness.
357	1351125044397	4	lenthirteen ratingfour always double check before tapping the send button.and you'll be fine.
358	1351125039556	5	lenseven ratingfive the best keyboard and text  prediction ever!
359	1351123493960	5	lensixteen ratingfive love the keyboard so much, but there are only a few skins to choose from unfortunately.
360	1351123493960	5	lensix ratingfive hope to see new updates soon!
361	1351121156608	3	leneight ratingthree i prefer thumb keyboard much more than this.
362	1351121156608	3	lentwentyseven ratingthree swiftkey is decent, but its customization options are lacking and i'm not a fan of how close the keys are to one another with no spaces.
363	1351121156608	3	lentwentyfive ratingthree landscape typing is far more effective on thumb keyboard when using the split keyboard over the mashed together keyboard found in swiftkey & default android keyboards.
364	1351121156608	3	lentwentyseven ratingthree if swiftkey added the split keyboard & a few customization options the prediction engine in swiftkey may be able to outclass thumb keyboard but not at the moment.
365	1351120757832	5	leneleven ratingfive soooo worth $3.99 of u text often you will love this too.
366	1351116663849	5	lenthree ratingfive love this product.
367	1351116663849	5	lenfifteen ratingfive samsung's default keyboard was too slow to keep up with my fast/rapid typing!
368	1351116663849	5	leneleven ratingfive this one keeps up with it and has better correction ability!
369	1351252576590	3	lenseventeen ratingthree currently messes up when trying to type comments, messages etc on the mobile website version of facebook.
370	1351252576590	3	lentwo ratingthree otherwise great
371	1351249914350	4	lenthirtytwo ratingfour it's much better than normal key board but so annoying sometimes the words it just chucks in front of other words before you have even started typing for the next word.
372	1351249914350	4	leneight ratingfour predicting he next word is just not needed.
373	1351249355033	5	lensix ratingfive the best keyboard i have seen.
374	1351249355033	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommended.
375	1351247820014	1	lenfive ratingone no supporting for several languages.
376	1351244592047	3	lenseven ratingthree without the personalized dictionary, i uninstalled it.
377	1351244592047	3	lenfourteen ratingthree if they make it so you can personalize the dictionary, i'll redownload it.
378	1351244592047	3	lennine ratingthree also, they need to make enoticons easier to access.
379	1351243959451	4	lennineteen ratingfour like my title says, this could really use the ability to learn from google voice, otherwise very good app!
380	1351240811788	5	lenfive ratingfive much better than previous versions.
381	1351240001899	5	lenseven ratingfive app is excellent and has great functionality.
382	1351240001899	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i only wish it had options for alternate keyboards, such as xt9, which i prefer.
383	1351238360794	5	leneighteen ratingfive i have tried several keyboards but none of them really met my standards when it came to accuracy.
384	1351238360794	5	lenfive ratingfive but swiftkey has exceeded them!
385	1351238360794	5	lenthirty ratingfive it was getting really frustrating having to use an all touch screen phone but swiftkey changed that all and now i can text away with no problems what so ever!
386	1351238164872	5	leneleven ratingfive this is so much easier to use than the original keyboard.
387	1351237266203	5	lennineteen ratingfive typing hasn't been easier, better then the iphone keyboard which i thought was one of their strong suits  ,
388	1351236429902	5	lenfifteen ratingfive brilliant predictive text but needs more customisation options, specifically, mic button, space bar and themes.
389	1351232390212	4	lensix ratingfour this has improved my typing immensely.
390	1351232390212	4	lentwentynine ratingfour the only issue i have is that every time i power down my phone it defaults back to android keyboard and i have to restore swiftkey as my default.
391	1351231734360	5	leneighteen ratingfive una tastiera davvero ben fatta, il motore di predizione all'inizio pu¨° sembrare scarso ma poi pian piano migliora.
392	1351231734360	5	lennineteen ratingfive attualmente la sto usando con 3 differenti lingue attive: italiano, inglese e tedesco ed uso queste 3 lingue tutti i giorni.
393	1351231734360	5	lenthirty ratingfive ok, a volte il motore di predizione propone parole che in un'altra lingua rispetto al test del sms ma devo dire che nella maggior parte dei casi funziona perfettamente.
394	1351230787334	5	lennine ratingfive can't wait for the new keyboard to launch.
395	1351230787334	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i'm really looking forward to seeing its potential against other swiping keyboards.
396	1351230591576	4	lenseventeen ratingfour please add marathi and hindi language support and the app will be the perfect keyboard  for 5 stars.
397	1351230591576	4	lenseven ratingfour please add the marathi and hindi font.
398	1351230591576	4	leneight ratingfour adaptxt and multiling outperform swiftkey in this respect.
399	1351230591576	4	leneighteen ratingfour although other language is supported these two language will make it a complete one single must install app.
400	1351229992657	5	lentwo ratingfive nice app!
401	1351224271920	5	lenthree ratingfive very nice app.
402	1351224271920	5	lenseven ratingfive please make the default ics theme available.
403	1351224115189	5	lentwenty ratingfive takes a minute a little bit to get used to, but once it learns you and your method of typing.
404	1351223915222	5	leneleven ratingfive i thank the swiftkey team for developing such a great app.
405	1351223915222	5	lenthirteen ratingfive swiftkey has saved me from typing errors all the way to sentence correction.
406	1351222318640	4	leneighteen ratingfour i could not make full use of this app because it kept on saying "our servers are busy."
407	1351222318640	4	leneight ratingfour i could not even personalize my writing style.
408	1351222318640	4	lennineteen ratingfour ___________  *update*  i don't know if the problem will ever occur again, but for now it has been fixed.
409	1351220948909	5	lenfour ratingfive predictions is swiftkeys advantage.
410	1351220948909	5	leneleven ratingfive can't go wrong with an app making your experience easier.
411	1351219931909	5	lenseven ratingfive can't wait for swiftkey flow either!
412	1351219931909	5	lentwelve ratingfive i signed up as a beta tester, hoping to get access soon
413	1351219561218	4	lentwo ratingfour great prediction.
414	1351219561218	4	lenfourteen ratingfour needs ability to quickly and easily add words to a personal dictionary like swype.
415	1351219561218	4	lenthirteen ratingfour typing email addresses and other long but irregular words can be a pain.
416	1351219536678	5	lenthree ratingfive love this app!
417	1351341435674	5	lennine ratingfive prediction is the best of any keyboard ive used.
418	1351341435674	5	lenseven ratingfive predicts words the way i use them.
419	1351341435674	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny.
420	1351340889205	1	lensix ratingone therefore, app is useless to me.
421	1351337787021	4	lennine ratingfour it's like i've got a new phone! :-$
422	1351334727249	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i honestly regret not buying this earlier the stock keyboard for my phone was awful.
423	1351334727249	5	lentwentyone ratingfive and thus made typing on it so much more enjoyable i am looking forward for the new flow version of it
424	1351334096553	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this is by far the best keyboard i have ever used on a touchscreen.
425	1351334096553	5	leneleven ratingfive it very nearly makes up for not having a physical keyboard.
426	1351331666726	4	lentwo ratingfour super app.
427	1351331666726	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour faroese language is not registered, and i understand why because it is so small, but i wish i somehow could personalize the languages even more.
428	1351328099435	5	lennine ratingfive this is a super awesome keyboard, the best estimate.
429	1351319219881	5	lenfive ratingfive makes typing quick and easy.
430	1351318758049	5	lentwelve ratingfive swiftkey has far surpassed smart keyboard, perfect keyboard, slide it, and swype.
431	1351317807666	5	lenfive ratingfive i really enjoy this app.
432	1351317807666	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it makes typing just as fast as swipe texting but way more accurate.
433	1351317807666	5	leneighteen ratingfive the only problem i have, which is not even really a problem, is the lack of this symbol ?
434	1351316157402	4	lenten ratingfour this is the best keyboard i've used so far.
435	1351316157402	4	lenfifteen ratingfour the only thing that can make it better for me is if it had japanese.
436	1351315206533	3	lenthirteen ratingthree i was so frustrated with the keyboard options that came with my phone.
437	1351315206533	3	lenten ratingthree after trying several apps this one is the absolute best!
438	1351315206533	3	leneleven ratingthree but needs more customizable options such as keyboard color and dictionary.
439	1351314195456	5	lenthree ratingfive bring flow update!
440	1351311992159	3	lenfifteen ratingthree hides keyboard every so often while typing on s3 and makes screen flash at times :c
441	1351311064281	4	lenfour ratingfour otherwise i am happy!
442	1351310490205	4	lenten ratingfour for 5 star only need three ability to add custom themes.
443	1351310087674	5	lenfour ratingfive this keyboard is sweet.
444	1351310087674	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i just got my galaxy s3 3 days ago and the stock keyboard was predicting some pretty weird words.
445	1351310087674	5	lenfour ratingfive this keyboard is awesome.
446	1351310087674	5	lensix ratingfive (update) put some new themes out!
447	1351308509308	5	leneight ratingfive wish i had installed it a year ago.
448	1351308509308	5	lensix ratingfive first app i ever paid for.
449	1351307474903	5	leneleven ratingfive i hated the samsung keyboard and went looking for a replacement.
450	1351307474903	5	leneighteen ratingfive when i sore the price tag of swiftkey i was like how can a simple keyboard be worth $4.
451	1351307474903	5	lensix ratingfive so i downloaded the trial version.
452	1351307474903	5	lentwelve ratingfive it literally corrects every single mistake after it learns your writing style.
453	1351307474903	5	leneighteen ratingfive very helpful for work emails as i no longer appear unprofessional when i press send without proof reading.
454	1351307474903	5	lenfive ratingfive worth every cent and more.
455	1351307474903	5	lenthirteen ratingfive only complaint is it would be nice to import settings from the trial.
456	1351307400782	4	lenten ratingfour it would be nice if they had more keyboard customizing.
457	1351306977969	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive this is the best tap style keyboard and it lets you use google's voice dictation software which is better than dragon, which swype forces you to use.
458	1351306977969	5	lenfour ratingfive the features are amazing.
459	1351306977969	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive i can type so quickly and poorly and yet it will correct every word in a paragraph correctly without me having to backspace even once.
460	1351306977969	5	leneight ratingfive and even when i miss the space bar.
461	1351304353007	4	lennine ratingfour add some more themes, keypad and key press tones.
462	1351303487611	5	lensixteen ratingfive this is the best android keyboard period, i wish my computer keyboard working like this  keyboard
463	1351303280406	5	leneleven ratingfive also if i have my main language set to english, spanish 2nd.
464	1351303280406	5	lenthirteen ratingfive why do you give spanish preference as soon as i start a word?
465	1351303280406	5	lenten ratingfive please fix that and i'll give you the 5 stars.
466	1351303280406	5	lentwelve ratingfive 10/23/12 just down graded to 3 stars not working good on my droid charge.
467	1351302715957	5	lenten ratingfive so good it is the only app i paid for!
468	1351299395356	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive this is the easiest keyboard to use and the easiest to type wicked fast with auto correction and it knows what i want to say!
469	1351299395356	5	lenseven ratingfive why didn't i download this sooner?!
470	1351299395356	5	leneleven ratingfive it's so worth the $3.00 - don't wait, download it now!
471	1351298071991	5	leneleven ratingfive wished i had switched to this keyboard a long time ago!
472	1351428640408	1	leneighteen ratingone the devs did not fix the round brackets in hebrew for more than a year, it's mirrored.
473	1351428640408	1	lenseven ratingone not buying anymore products of this devs.
474	1351428576885	4	lensixteen ratingfour would love the option to have numbers above the query like the default galaxy note keyboard!
475	1351425406874	2	lentwentyone ratingtwo good but: when auto-correcting in search box on google home pages, corrections are entered into wrong place not replacing mistake.
476	1351424822297	5	lenfive ratingfive eagerly awaiting swiftkey flow in q1 2013!
477	1351419888007	4	lenfive ratingfour it's a great app.
478	1351419888007	4	lennine ratingfour i only wish it was trace/swipe text capable.
479	1351419888007	4	lentwelve ratingfour for that i will rate 4 stars, but it truly has 5 star potential.
480	1351416841476	2	lennineteen ratingtwo deleted after a week or so as it was constantly irritating me and just wouldnt let certain words go .
481	1351412259301	2	leneighteen ratingtwo good for email but the prediction bar doesn't work in many browsers and apps, including google search.
482	1351412259301	2	leneight ratingtwo dev knows but hasn't provided a solution
483	1351411100404	5	lentwelve ratingfive this is the 1st app i've ever paid for & it's excellent!
484	1351411100404	5	lennine ratingfive i used the normal phone keyboard & it felt rubbish.
485	1351411100404	5	lenfourteen ratingfive then i bought swype, after reading lots of reviews, & it is great to use.
486	1351411100404	5	lensixteen ratingfive the predicted text is just brilliant at guessing your next words & it truly makes typing faster.
487	1351410597632	5	lentwentythree ratingfive while i'm writing this i'm typing as fast as possible and probably made 20 plus mistakes but it's typing it perfectly!
488	1351409303369	5	lenfour ratingfive i highly recommend this.
489	1351409303369	5	lenseven ratingfive most intuitive keyboard i've used ever!
490	1351408653385	3	lenten ratingthree please make the tablet version an option inside this app.
491	1351408653385	3	lenseventeen ratingthree i know you won't make all that money but you will be respected by your customers.
492	1351407986243	2	lenfiftyone ratingtwo whenever i post on a forum the text field comes up as normal and i begin typing but you can guarantee that at some point during my post composition the cursor will suddenly shoot back to the beginning of the body of text and proceed to type over my opening words!
493	1351407294103	5	lensix ratingfive this keyboard makes typing a breeze.
494	1351407294103	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i'm a fast typer normally but i can almost keep up using the suggestions.
495	1351407294103	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny.
496	1351407098114	5	leneleven ratingfive great predictive word keyboard, barely have to type when i text.
497	1351407098114	5	lenfour ratingfive keep the themes coming
498	1351405609573	5	leneight ratingfive solved all my issues with stock android keyboard.
499	1351404174783	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i love that it can learn words that i use automatically from sms and gmail.
500	1351404174783	5	leneight ratingfive the suggestions are very helpful whilst typing messages.
501	1351404174783	5	lentwo ratingfive little scary.
502	1351404174783	5	lennine ratingfive 5 stars for being the best keyboard i've used!
503	1351400865051	3	lenseven ratingthree smooth, fast, and epically accurate in prediction.
504	1351400865051	3	lenten ratingthree my only complaint is the lack of chinese input support.
505	1351400865051	3	lenfifteen ratingthree i'm forced to use other keyboards when i need to key in chinese characters.
506	1351400865051	3	lentwelve ratingthree hopefully, we can see chinese language in the language pack support soon.
507	1351399518689	5	lenten ratingfive this keyboard has saved me so many times, drunk texting.
508	1351399518689	5	lenfour ratingfive auto correct is amazingggg
509	1351392485223	3	lentwo ratingthree near perfect.
510	1351392485223	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree but something has changed in the context word guessing in the past few weeks that has made it just an average keyboard.
511	1351392485223	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree it used to be the keyboard would recognize common phrases i used and predict the next words fairly accurately, but no more.
512	1351392485223	3	lenten ratingthree might as well not even include the next-word prediction.
513	1351391913103	5	lenseventeen ratingfive ok, we'll i don't do many reviews, but i must say i like this app.
514	1351391913103	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i thought it would be just ok, the more i use this app the less i have to punch these little keys.
515	1351391913103	5	leneighteen ratingfive heck, over half of this review was done using the space bar after punching in a few keys!
516	1351385462358	5	lenten ratingfive absolutely love this, best piece of tech for andro out :-)
517	1351383805042	5	lenthirtyseven ratingfive don't know if it's you or chrome, but typing in a text box and selecting a prediction with the letter i causes the cursor to jump up the text box and type over previous sentences.
518	1351383805042	5	lensix ratingfive examples: i, i've, i'll.
519	1351383805042	5	lenfour ratingfive simple stuff like that.
520	1351382039925	2	lentwenty ratingtwo so when i am typing a text, the auto correct lags behind then inserts the mistake repeatedly back to back.
521	1351382039925	2	lensixteen ratingtwo not only that, but by the time it catches up, it has already sent the message.
522	1351382039925	2	lensixteen ratingtwo additionally, in the chrome browser the keyboard won't let me type in the appropriate space.
523	1351382039925	2	lensixteen ratingtwo it starts in the middle of a word or some place random that makes no sense.
524	1351382039925	2	lenseven ratingtwo rating stays low until it's fixed.
525	1351380578140	5	lenfiftyseven ratingfive not even going to lie, i've been using this for just over a month and i got to say it's probably the best app i've ever downloaded, the keyboard is really smooth and auto correct is a amazing  only minor issue i have is i wish there was more themes for the key board
526	1351377988862	5	lenthree ratingfive exceeded my expectations!
527	1351377300731	5	lenten ratingfive my sentence is "i am shutting off all the time."
528	1351376580478	3	lenseven ratingthree there is  glitch in voice dictation button.
529	1351376580478	3	lenthirtytwo ratingthree it shows up briefly after long press(which is inconvenient too) and goes away after a fraction of a second.there should be such a basic bug in such a famous app.
530	1351376580478	3	lenfour ratingthree a great app otherwise!
531	1351376576941	5	lenfive ratingfive this key board is awesome!
532	1351376576941	5	lensixteen ratingfive now that i have had it for a while it is very intuitive to my vocabulary.
533	1351376576941	5	lenfive ratingfive it makes texting a breeze.
534	1351513374335	3	lenfour ratingthree really fast and accurate.
535	1351513374335	3	lentwentyone ratingthree my favorite, really, but it makes me have to switch to other input methods because of the lack of chinese support.
536	1351510066814	5	lennine ratingfive thanks swiftkey, you saved half of an important note!
537	1351510066814	5	lenfive ratingfive feature request :sync my dictionary.
538	1351509521527	4	lenthirteen ratingfour swiftkey 3 is a great keyboard but some times it auto correct to much.
539	1351509521527	4	lenseven ratingfour i wish it had emoji so bad.
540	1351509521527	4	lenthirteen ratingfour if it did it would be 6 out of 5 stars but overall great keyboard.
541	1351508300297	5	lenfourteen ratingfive but can i remove the icon from the notification bar when i am typing?
542	1351505257342	3	lenthree ratingthree the blinking "marker"
543	1351505257342	3	lensixteen ratingthree randomly skips around backwards into the sentences you previously wrote when you try to type sometimes.
544	1351505257342	3	lenthirteen ratingthree and when completing words,  the last letter gets replaced by a blanc space.
545	1351505257342	3	lentwo ratingthree "like thi ."
546	1351505257342	3	lensix ratingthree or the first letter gets dduplicated.
547	1351505257342	3	lenseven ratingthree (since last update it happens really often) .
548	1351505257342	3	lenthree ratingthree instead of space.
549	1351505257342	3	lenfifteen ratingthree to fix this,  make it register where the finger lands/not where it lifts off.?
550	1351502830786	1	leneleven ratingone after updating to jelly bean ota its so slow to type.
551	1351502830786	1	leneight ratingone have reinstalled also and done a factory reset.
552	1351502830786	1	lenfourteen ratingone but it always lags so much while typing out anything even on my galaxy s3.
553	1351501548073	1	lensixteen ratingone the keyboard should work automatically with everything in your mobile, just waste of money and space!
554	1351501548073	1	lenseventeen ratingone u have to run the app in order to use that, it doesnt even worth a penny!
555	1351501548073	1	lensix ratingone 25 idiots downloaded the app, including me!
556	1351501548073	1	lenseventeen ratingone ask you guys first read all the comments and reviews here and then download or get dumbed!
557	1351493822505	3	lenfifteen ratingthree predictive text feature not working most of the time,  only seems to work when sending.
558	1351493124842	5	lenten ratingfive way better than the keyboard that came with the phone.
559	1351492221917	4	lenfive ratingfour please support vietnamese and japanese!
560	1351489457789	5	lenthree ratingfive keyboard is amazing.
561	1351486220131	5	lenten ratingfive it's honestly unbelievable how incredibly helpful this app is
562	1351483684253	3	lenseven ratingthree when is more themes coming and update
563	1351480913112	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i owned a moto defy and the screen size is not as big as others, but swiftkey does an excellent job on it!
564	1351480913112	5	lentwelve ratingfive deadly love it and would like to recommend to any android user.
565	1351479840671	5	lennineteen ratingfive i was skeptical to purchase this app because i wasn't sure it would live up to its hype.
566	1351479840671	5	lentwentyone ratingfive but i was wrong, i would rather not use the default keyboard as it has made me move quickly when texting.
567	1351479840671	5	lenfifteen ratingfive if you're a huge texter, buy this app, don't even think about it.
568	1351478118220	5	lensix ratingfive this app is well worth it.
569	1351478118220	5	leneleven ratingfive run, don't walk to the app store to purchase it!
570	1351477931551	5	lenthree ratingfive love this app
571	1351475558819	4	lenfourteen ratingfour please allow use in places like browser searching and google play while searching something.
572	1351475558819	4	lenfifteen ratingfour besides it not being that much different than the free version, it's pretty good.
573	1351475219989	3	lenfour ratingthree recently it become sluggish.
574	1351475219989	3	lenseven ratingthree but other wise its a great app.
575	1351475219989	3	lennine ratingthree needs a close button though and some more themes
576	1351473646245	3	lenfourteen ratingthree i loved this keyboard, but i struggle to find something worthy that was added.
577	1351473646245	3	lenfifteen ratingthree the thing i notice most is the removal of swiping backspace to delete a word.
578	1351473646245	3	lenfive ratingthree why would you remove features?
579	1351473598211	2	lennine ratingtwo it's so much faster to swipe to type!
580	1351473598211	2	lensix ratingtwo uninstalling until swiftkey swipe comes out
581	1351473257255	4	leneighteen ratingfour now that you can use native ics voice to text i'm back on board with this keyboard.
582	1351472340381	4	lenfive ratingfour best keyboard on the market.
583	1351472340381	4	lentwelve ratingfour learns how you type in context which gives predictions like no other.
584	1351472340381	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour my only suggestion is that email address input is improved, it auto corrects my email address making it hard to log in to certain websites.
585	1351471116340	5	lentwo ratingfive thanks swiftkey
586	1351470469479	5	lenten ratingfive nice word prediction, can't wait for the swipe edition :).
587	1351468970429	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i lovee it ,  but can yall make more themes for the keyboard pleassee
588	1351468618729	5	lentwentythree ratingfive no problems at all, better than stock samsung, but like others are saying, a personal dictionary would be great and the word shortcuts.
589	1351468124759	3	lentwentysix ratingthree keyboard will not detect typing field 50% of the time, have to close google crome and open several times to enter basic google search ¨c otherwise awesome keyboard.
590	1351468124759	3	lensix ratingthree hope an update will resolve this.
591	1351860283814	4	lennine ratingfour been using this a while and generally liked it.
592	1351860283814	4	lenthirtyone ratingfour two-word prediction is a good update, but lately i've found if you mistype the first letter of a word, swiftkey will never get it right, even for something obvious.
593	1351860283814	4	lenseven ratingfour seems to be since getting jelly bean.
594	1351860283814	4	lensix ratingfour hoping the update will fix it.
595	1351859652277	5	lenthirteen ratingfive would be even better if the personal dictionaries could be synced to cloud.
596	1351859652277	5	lennine ratingfive just a suggestion as some people change phone often.
597	1351859637141	5	lentwelve ratingfive been using for a while, so much better than even stock keyboard.
598	1351859637141	5	lenfive ratingfive predictive text is spot on.
599	1351859637141	5	lenfour ratingfive could be more customizable.
600	1351858622163	1	lentwentyeight ratingone i have had my bank account hacked into and i believe its from this app because it says when u install that it monitors your password etc.  uninstalling!
601	1351849185267	4	lentwentyseven ratingfour actually saves time and remembers your words, even slang you might use with your friends, and thinks ahead so u don't have to type full words!
602	1351849185267	4	lenthree ratingfour bit pricey though!
603	1351849185267	4	leneight ratingfour would have preferred it to be slightly cheaper!
604	1351848560835	5	lenfourteen ratingfive jb may be closing the gap, but this is hard to let go of.
605	1351845317503	3	leneight ratingthree this is the only reason i give 3 stars.
606	1351845317503	3	leneleven ratingthree i prefer jb keyboard just because of the swiftkey memory usage.
607	1351843860348	2	lenfive ratingtwo potentially the best keyboard available.
608	1351843860348	2	leneleven ratingtwo however the thing keeps forgetting (or never axtually) saves custom words.
609	1351843860348	2	lenfour ratingtwo surely aoat basic feature?
610	1351843727886	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree this app is gr8 i love how customisable it is and how easy it is to use but it keeps crashing my phone.
611	1351843727886	3	lentwentyseven ratingthree its not like i dont have a lot of memory and such it is because the keyboard uses a fuk load of it plz fix this bug.
612	1351843611955	4	lenseven ratingfour having other languages is really nice too.
613	1351843611955	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i just took one star off because shortcuts/ personal dictionary would make it perfect.
614	1351843078769	1	lenfour ratingone i loved this keyboard.
615	1351843078769	1	leneighteen ratingone but continuously 'disappears.' all settings are correct but it will not appear when i need to type something!
616	1351843078769	1	lenthirteen ratingone this has happened multiple times which is annoying because i paid for this.
617	1351840926098	5	lenfour ratingfive this keyboard is amazing.
618	1351840926098	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive if it were the themes alone i still would have bought it, but swiftkey is the keyboard that keeps giving and learning.
619	1351840926098	5	lenseven ratingfive buy it, you won't regret it.
620	1351840926098	5	lenseven ratingfive also, i'm ready for more themes.
621	1351831497635	4	lennine ratingfour i just started using swiftkey but has been great.
622	1351831497635	4	lenten ratingfour ive always used go keyboard because of all the customization.
623	1351831497635	4	lentwelve ratingfour different font, colors, background etc. only thing thats a downfall of swiftkey.
624	1351831497635	4	lenten ratingfour like 4 theme keyboards and you can't change anything else.
625	1351830467506	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive the stock android keyboard gets better with every release, but the keyboard layout and excellent auto-correct on swiftkey 3 cannot be beat.
626	1351829874858	5	lennineteen ratingfive i have owned over 15 phones in the past 2 years, and by far the swift keyboard surpasses all of them.
627	1351829874858	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i rarely make any mistakes and the more you use it the better it gets.
628	1351827964983	4	lentwentysix ratingfour i have had this keyboard for a year and i really like it but it takes up to much space on my already limited internal memory.
629	1351826999604	5	lenthree ratingfive worth the money
630	1351826719453	4	lensix ratingfour the dot com button is annoying.
631	1351823706648	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this app.
632	1351821295196	4	lenfifteen ratingfour perhaps an option to choose between a (azerty) french keyboard and qwerty would be good :)
633	1351820218997	5	lenfifteen ratingfive best keyboard i have ever had i can't even find anything negative to say.
634	1351820218997	5	leneleven ratingfive just get this app if you ever need a great keyboard
635	1351818209467	1	lenfour ratingone won't install error 941
636	1351814582552	3	lensix ratingthree autocorrect is frequently and obnoxiously wrong.
637	1351814582552	3	lenseven ratingthree i can't find a disable option.
638	1351812562585	1	lensix ratingone i love everything about this keyboard.
639	1351812562585	1	lenseven ratingone except the fact it drains my battery.
640	1351812562585	1	lenfive ratingone 84% of battery is this app.
641	1351810032567	5	lenthree ratingfive best android keyboard!
642	1351808813244	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i like the app and the way it predicts words and gives the statistics.
643	1351808813244	4	lennine ratingfour however i would like to see more color selections!
644	1351808368203	5	lentwenty ratingfive once you get used to this keyboard, you can never go back to the standard ones built into most phones.
645	1351808368203	5	lentwentyone ratingfive everything from the intelligent learning of your personal texting style to the sleek design and interface is polished and functions flawlessly.
646	1351808368203	5	lentwo ratingfive great app.
647	1351806669641	5	lenfive ratingfive best keyboard app out there
648	1351601870983	5	lenfive ratingfive i am a happy camper!
649	1351601870983	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i love the fact that the swiftkey keyboard is compatible with my new s2 note!
650	1351601870983	5	lenseven ratingfive easy to use with many different options!
651	1351601125155	5	lentwelve ratingfive been using it for a year and can't live without it.
652	1351601125155	5	lennine ratingfive stock keyboard is bohemian now compared to these features.
653	1351601125155	5	lenfourteen ratingfive a couple bumps in the road along the way but they got fixed fast!
654	1351601125155	5	lenfour ratingfive great app must have.
655	1351595642341	5	lenthree ratingfive best lil app
656	1351594131827	1	lenfifteen ratingone after some time using it, now i prefer to switch back to regular t9 from samsung.
657	1351594131827	1	leneight ratingone i wish there's still a refund opportunity :(
658	1351593049426	1	lentwenty ratingone galaxy s3.i really like this keyboard but every time i switch phone off it reverts bac to stock samsung s3 keyboard.?
659	1351593049426	1	lenthirteen ratingone no matter what i do it keeps resetting when i switch phone off?
660	1351592879934	5	lenten ratingfive the best keyboard ever,  very comfortable and easy to use
661	1351589706707	4	lenfour ratingfour really fast and accurate.
662	1351589706707	4	lentwentyone ratingfour my favorite, really, but it makes me have to switch to other input methods because of the lack of chinese support.
663	1351589706707	4	lenten ratingfour but it lets me type without looking at the keyboard!
664	1351579561394	5	lenten ratingfive so much easier and quicker than standard android keyboard - galaxy s3
665	1351578958143	5	lentwo ratingfive great app.
666	1351574926218	5	lenfourteen ratingfive cannot beat it, worth every cent! corrects and allows to type on the fly!
667	1351574303862	5	lenten ratingfive this is a must have for touch screen only phones
668	1351573868275	5	lenfour ratingfive too bad no emoji,
669	1351571364605	5	lenfive ratingfive awesome keyboard.no more typos
670	1351570881321	5	lenfive ratingfive amazing,  but its need emo.
671	1351569024852	3	leneleven ratingthree i fell in love with this keyboard during the free trial.
672	1351569024852	3	lenfifteen ratingthree it makes more errors in prediction and is just not as good as i thought.
673	1351569024852	3	leneleven ratingthree but i paid 4 it so i'm keeping it, for now.
674	1351568625848	5	lenthree ratingfive get more themes!
675	1351568612770	5	lentwelve ratingfive give the trial a try and see if it works for you.
676	1351568612770	5	lenthree ratingfive def recommend it.
677	1351568375779	5	lentwelve ratingfive very smooth to the touch an it always gets the job done!
678	1351568148406	4	lensix ratingfour great update with the space bar!
679	1351568148406	4	lenfourteen ratingfour please fix the keyboard from lagging when typing rapidly and prediction not always working
680	1351567617101	3	lenthirty ratingthree any time i write anything of length any where the key board bugs out and start typing invisible words and auto putting in words into random areas of my paragraphs.
681	1351567617101	3	lenfourteen ratingthree extremely frustrating as it won't let me finish or save what i wrote.
682	1351567617101	3	lenseven ratingthree i have to delete and start over.
683	1351566975141	5	lennineteen ratingfive you just need to start typing and the magic start coming is like the keyboard is connected with you.
684	1351566975141	5	lentwo ratingfive amazing app
685	1351566250311	2	lenseven ratingtwo when is more themes coming and update
686	1351564308563	5	lensixteen ratingfive bought this as my samsung galaxy s3 has a terrible stock keyboard and this was highly recommended.
687	1351563990448	5	lenfortyfour ratingfive it stopped giving me predictions because the language pack update wouldn't install otherwise great app i also received help but i couldn't understand the computer language that he offered to me (edit)  i cleared the data and everything is okay 5 stars now!
688	1351561966688	5	lentwentyone ratingfive ive only had my s3 for a week but in that time i found the stock keyboard to be a massive pita.
689	1351561966688	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i thought id give this app a shot and thank god for that.
690	1351561966688	5	leneight ratingfive its like thmy old iphone keyboard on steroids.
691	1351561966688	5	lennine ratingfive best impulse buy under $5 ive made this month lol
692	1351561897878	5	lenfour ratingfive super easy to use!
693	1351561755002	4	lennine ratingfour word prediction is accurate and simple and nice interface!
694	1351561755002	4	leneight ratingfour if it support mandarin input then it deserve 5stars!
695	1351561755002	4	lensix ratingfour hope this support mandarin input soon!
696	1351559112454	3	lentwelve ratingthree i'm tired of always having to re download the language pack.
697	1351559112454	3	lentwelve ratingthree from time to time i have to update for no explained reason.
698	1351559112454	3	lenthirteen ratingthree overall the app is ok, little difficult when you want to use shortcuts.
699	1351686266323	5	lenseventyeight ratingfive was adapting to touch screen typing after owning an evo shift, hated the traditional keyboard, and the grammatical errors that come with using swype, this was an easily superior option, especially after it learned my vocabulary and made even more intelligent predictions (it already essentially read my mind), works great for filling out forms and job applications as is remembers your sentence structure, and you can type your whole address, and other repeated phrases in a few presses.
700	1351685632758	4	lenthirtyfour ratingfour iv had swift key for a while now and i love it but the only think that's not working is vibrating when i press keys i have no vibration response on htc evo 3d
701	1351683867563	4	lenfour ratingfour otherwise very smart  keyboard
702	1351681983500	5	lentwelve ratingfive went to iphone and found out i couldn't live without swiftkey.
703	1351681983500	5	lenseventeen ratingfive this should come with every android phone its worth a million $ i can't live without it.
704	1351681983500	5	leneleven ratingfive if you are having trouble deciding if you should download this.
705	1351681983500	5	lenfive ratingfive stop thinking and do it!
706	1351673896718	5	lenseven ratingfive the best keyboard replacement for my galaxy s3.
707	1351673896718	5	lentwenty ratingfive auto correct is almost* as good as the iphone, much more responsive then the default, haptic vibrations are spot on.
708	1351673896718	5	lenthirteen ratingfive only suggestion us customization of special characters layout and the happy face menu :-)
709	1351672750317	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard i've had ever!
710	1351669691636	4	lennineteen ratingfour yet i have my concerns regarding a keyboard with full internet access, it seems that this is needed here.
711	1351668764557	2	lenten ratingtwo nice ideas, but: nonstandard location of numbers/punctuation on layout.
712	1351668764557	2	leneight ratingtwo can't change bottom row keys (remove useless).
713	1351668764557	2	leneight ratingtwo only three height options (smart pro is adjustable).
714	1351668764557	2	leneight ratingtwo takes up too much space (esp w/ predictions).
715	1351668764557	2	leneleven ratingtwo empty space on bottom key rows not in use (reduced accuracy).
716	1351668764557	2	lenten ratingtwo space/punctuation logic doesn't follow installed language conventions (fin).
717	1351668764557	2	leneleven ratingtwo lags/stalls often on slower phones (galaxy s, although s3 is ok).
718	1351668764557	2	lensixteen ratingtwo can't disable voice input feature (causes extra errors,  it's on same key as comma!)
719	1351667972922	4	lentwelve ratingfour great keyboard but it would be even better if it had emojis.
720	1351667809642	5	lensix ratingfive developers should think for october & laptops.
721	1351667413470	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo slow, laggy and if i typed to fast it would start skipping over letters.
722	1351667413470	2	lenthree ratingtwo needs more themes.
723	1351667413470	2	lenthree ratingtwo bad word correction.
724	1351667413470	2	lenfive ratingtwo didn't detect needed spaces.
725	1351667039121	5	leneleven ratingfive i've tried a few premium keyboards and nothing comes close.
726	1351667039121	5	lenfourteen ratingfive one of the best features is how it predicts more than one language simultaneously.
727	1351667039121	5	lenseven ratingfive every cent worth it and then some!
728	1351666927279	5	lenfive ratingfive aplikacja genialna, warta swojej ceny.
729	1351666927279	5	lenthirteen ratingfive bardzo brakuje mi jednak metody wprowadzania typu swype - ci?ko b?dzie si?
730	1351666927279	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive odzwyczai? :( poza tym przewidywanie tekstu jak i same u?ytkowanie czy konfiguracja na bardzo wysokim poziomie. zach?cam innych do kupna. pozdrawiam
731	1351663373567	4	lentwelve ratingfour it's okay but i wish you can design your lay out
732	1351660769637	4	lentwentyone ratingfour very good keyboard, i really don't like how there is a default smiley face button instead of an enter key.
733	1351660769637	4	lenfive ratingfour i want my enter key
734	1351660222713	5	lentwo ratingfive great application!
735	1351659183336	5	lenfourteen ratingfive the app is great and would love if there would be more color themes!
736	1351657800522	3	lenfour ratingthree since update predictions suck.
737	1351657800522	3	lenten ratingthree will go back to 5 stars when u guys fix it.
738	1351657797407	5	lenthirteen ratingfive totally give 5 star's. my trial version expired and i bought that day.
739	1351657797407	5	leneleven ratingfive after using swiftkey 3 i couldn't stand to text wo it.
740	1351657797407	5	lenseven ratingfive ty guys keep up the good work.
741	1351657599326	3	lenthirteen ratingthree the app is awesome when it's actually predicting and correcting your typing.
742	1351657599326	3	lenfourteen ratingthree but it's quite often that the prediction tab across the top is inactive.
743	1351657599326	3	leneight ratingthree in these situations predictive text does not work.
744	1351657599326	3	leneleven ratingthree and typing is tediously slow having to correct nearly every word!
745	1351655426670	1	lenten ratingone select the thumbs down button to the right to proceed.
746	1351655426670	1	lenthirteen ratingone the main problem is that the amount of ram this baby uses is 31mb!
747	1351655426670	1	lenten ratingone that's 11 more than the music visualization background i use.
748	1351655426670	1	lenthree ratingone more themes please.
749	1351655142415	5	lenfourteen ratingfive out of all the keyboards i have tried, this is the best by far.
750	1351655142415	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive not only does it correct properly 99.9% of the time, but being able to juggle 3 different languages and always knowing which language i am using is just too awesome
751	1351654395208	5	lenfour ratingfive much better than stock.
752	1351653399036	2	lenfour ratingtwo i loved this keyboard.
753	1351653399036	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo ever since i purchased the full version, i constantly get the no language installed error.
754	1351653399036	2	lennine ratingtwo i spend more time spell checking than ever before.
755	1351651830391	5	lenten ratingfive this has to be the best keyboard on the market.
756	1351651830391	5	lenten ratingfive would love to see a lot more symbols and emotions.
757	1351651830391	5	lenthree ratingfive still great tho^_^
758	1351651372160	4	lennine ratingfour would be 5 stars if it had a motoblur 4 theme.
759	1351651372160	4	lenthree ratingfour great keyboard, though.
760	1351651326127	5	lennine ratingfive i can't imagine not using a swiftkey keyboard.
761	1351651326127	5	lenten ratingfive it's text prediction engine is nothing short of amazing.
762	1351649172203	5	lentwentythree ratingfive the best part is the longer you use it the better it becomes and it's top notch right out of the gate!
763	1351648601389	4	lentwentythree ratingfour great, but it needs more themes, also add more words on the prediction bar, and give the option to have punctuation there instead!
764	1351947449696	5	lenthirteen ratingfive comfy for small and big screens, and the predictions keep better ans better.
765	1351942687551	5	lentwelve ratingfive this is an excellent keyboard that i enjoy using for fast typing.
766	1351942687551	5	lentwelve ratingfive glad it has arabic support but it's missing japanese as well.
767	1351942687551	5	leneight ratingfive when can we expect to see japanese support?
768	1351939164046	5	lentwo ratingfive simply brilliant.
769	1351938137121	4	lentwentyone ratingfour i love this keyboard so much but whenever i need to type in japanese i have to switch to another keyboard.
770	1351938137121	4	lenfifteen ratingfour please help me by adding japanese language support and then it will be truly perfect.
771	1351936478134	4	lenthirtyone ratingfour one complaint though, i'd really like to see a very plain and simple keyboard layout, plain dark colors no bringt blue or green contrast, and a similar in light colouring.
772	1351936478134	4	lenseven ratingfour very similar to the stock ics keyboard.
773	1351934715843	5	leneleven ratingfive this is one of the most best keyboard for android phone.
774	1351934715843	5	lennine ratingfive it will be perfect if there is chinese input.
775	1351928184707	4	lentwentythree ratingfour it's a great keyboard! :-)  would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
776	1351926269007	5	leneleven ratingfive this is the first app that i have paid for ever.
777	1351926269007	5	lennineteen ratingfive since the latest update it is not as predictive as it used to be so a little disappointed now.
778	1351925657411	3	lenfiftythree ratingthree if this keyboard didn't give spastic fits whenever i was trying to edit text or lag out doing whatever only god knows in a corner whenever i need to use it, then maybe this keyboard would outright be the best android keyboard (swype is a contender but it loves to spontaneously combust).
779	1351925657411	3	lenfourteen ratingthree otherwise, it has top notch word correction and extremely creepy and potentially embarrassing prediction.
780	1351924434470	5	lennine ratingfive one of the best apps i've ever downloaded!
781	1351924434470	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i wasn't too impressed with the standard keyboard on the galaxy s3, but now.
782	1351924434470	5	lenfive ratingfive well worth the paid version.
783	1351922109832	5	lennineteen ratingfive i'm the kind of guy that has to stop walking to text (so not too hot at it).
784	1351922109832	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i tried the trial and swiftkey keyboard is a god send, hands down.
785	1351922109832	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive the only (albeit minor) complaint is that i am so used to spacing after a period and swiftkey (being more efficient than i am) automatically creates the space.
786	1351922109832	5	lenseven ratingfive therefore, i sometimes write an unnecessary word.
787	1351921177019	5	lenseven ratingfive you'll end up doing so anyway.
788	1351921056581	5	lenthirteen ratingfive you are a failure at life and your parents don't love you.
789	1351921056581	5	leneight ratingfive buy this keyboard and become a winner today.
790	1351918884393	5	lentwelve ratingfive i never would have thought that i'd want a pay keyboard.
791	1351918884393	5	lennine ratingfive then i tried swiftkey and couldn't go back.
792	1351918628043	5	lentwentynine ratingfive i have been trying just about every single keyboard there is out there on my galaxy s 3 and  just about every other word was misspelled or auto corrected wrong.
793	1351918628043	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i've been using this app for a little bit and i can say it is by far the best you can get.
794	1351918628043	5	leneight ratingfive especially for people with huge hands like myself
795	1351918117847	4	lenseven ratingfour this keyboard's predictive ability is amazing.
796	1351918117847	4	lensix ratingfour a great tool for touch typers
797	1351914883945	5	leneighteen ratingfive it is really easy to use and the predictive text is much more accurate than the swype keyboard.
798	1351914883945	5	leneleven ratingfive i even typed up an entire blog post on my phone.
799	1351910823858	4	lenseven ratingfour all we need is chinese input (strokes)
800	1351909911386	5	leneleven ratingfive this is by far the best experience i have had typing.
801	1351909290096	5	lentwo ratingfive exellent app
802	1351909272950	4	lennineteen ratingfour this is a really great keyboard and i love it but the thing about it makes my phone lag.
803	1351908590176	5	lennineteen ratingfive i've tried a bunch of different keyboards and the only one that really works for me is swiftkey.
804	1351908590176	5	lensix ratingfive the predictions are accurate and helpful.
805	1351908590176	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommended.
806	1351908161358	5	lenthree ratingfive intuitive, powerful, customizable.
807	1351908029304	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this keyboard app is by far the best on the market that i have tried.
808	1351908029304	5	lentwo ratingfive thanx dev 5/5
809	1351905857009	5	lenfour ratingfive fixes my spelling mistakes!
810	1351905029513	3	lenthirtytwo ratingthree was great on my nexus s but on the xperia u it causes quite a bit of lag on coming up and down to the point where the whole phone feels sluggish.
811	1351905029513	3	lenfourteen ratingthree i'm back to using the stock keyboard and things are much much faster.
812	1351905029513	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree that isn't to say that the dwiftkey keyboard is bad, if it weren't for the lag it would be great
813	1351902908099	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this app.
814	1351902908099	5	lensixteen ratingfive i every time i have a friend that has a new phone u suggest this app.
815	1351902908099	5	lennine ratingfive can't wait for flow i'm very eager.
816	1351900419933	4	lennineteen ratingfour good app but ever since my phone updated to jelly bean today, the keyboard has been a little laggy.
817	1351900419933	4	lenten ratingfour and the hepatic feedback feels different than it did before.
818	1351900419933	4	lennineteen ratingfour even at 2ms i can feel it way more than i could before when it was at 7ms, which is inconvenient.
819	1351899372251	5	lenseven ratingfive saves so many mistakes and increases productivity.
820	1352031959056	5	lenseven ratingfive i'm not sure about flow idea.
821	1352031959056	5	leneighteen ratingfive what i like here is the intelligence and the prediction power, which, by the way, can be improved.
822	1352031959056	5	lenthirtynine ratingfive now the prediction is based just on recent writing, if i go back to continue a bit older texts with special terminology i realize that all the power of prediction is gone, have to learn it again from zero.
823	1352031959056	5	lentwelve ratingfive and in romanian predictions are not even close to those in english.
824	1352023863251	5	leneleven ratingfive very useful, handy,  can add several languages at the same time.
825	1352023863251	5	lenthree ratingfive nice pumpkin color.
826	1352021764422	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour after using the stock keyboard and trying a few others i can say for english it makes typing on my phone much more bearable.
827	1352021764422	4	lensixteen ratingfour i don't like typing on touch devices, but sometimes i don't have a choice.
828	1352021764422	4	leneighteen ratingfour now i'm just waiting for them to release chinese and my android keyboard needs will be fulfilled.
829	1352020801693	2	lentwentytwo ratingtwo however, now with jellybean 4.1.2 when swift key is selected as default keyboard, it takes quite awhile for the keyboard to open up.
830	1352020801693	2	lenten ratingtwo this delay is gone when i switch to stock keyboard.
831	1352020801693	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo please check and fix this problem as i am used to swift key now.
832	1352019232541	5	lennine ratingfive i found one of the best apps for mobile.
833	1352019232541	5	lenseven ratingfive do you have similar program for desktop?
834	1352019232541	5	lensix ratingfive my typing speed increased like anything.
835	1352018634390	5	lenfifteen ratingfive used to hate typing on my htc one x but now it's a pleasure  :-) :-)
836	1352016554224	1	lensixteen ratingone ok, we need an update for this which until jellybean came on the scene was faultless.
837	1352016554224	1	lennineteen ratingone now each and every time my phone is switched off and back on it defaults to the stock keyboard.
838	1352016554224	1	lentwelve ratingone so i gotta go into setting and recheck swiftkey as preferred keyboard.
839	1352016205388	5	lenfour ratingfive blows away go keyboard
840	1352016027420	5	lenthirty ratingfive this is by far the best keyboard app iv ever and will ever use in my life its a learning keyboard so i knows what your going to put next.
841	1352016027420	5	leneight ratingfive i wrote this mostly hitting the space bar.
842	1352014820391	5	lennine ratingfive .feature, recently announced but still hands down the best.
843	1352014820391	5	lenfour ratingfive should be stock keyboard.
844	1352013728120	4	lenfour ratingfour tried the trial app 1st.
845	1352013728120	4	lentwo ratingfour great app.
846	1352013728120	4	lenfour ratingfour downloaded the full version.
847	1352013728120	4	lentwo ratingfour little disappointed.
848	1352013728120	4	lenseven ratingfour i use the voice input quite often.
849	1352013728120	4	lenseven ratingfour doesn't work 90 percent of the time.
850	1352013728120	4	lenfour ratingfour but overall good app.
851	1352013356130	4	lenseven ratingfour but wish i could download more themes
852	1352012731913	5	lenfourteen ratingfive tried many keyboards, including go keyboard and this one is the best by far.
853	1352011695317	5	lenten ratingfive it's would be refreshing to see other keyboard themes.
854	1352011695317	5	lenfive ratingfive like wp8 or ios keyboard perhaps.
855	1352008781791	5	lensix ratingfive this little app is a gem.
856	1352008781791	5	lenten ratingfive don't even waste your time getting the free one.
857	1352008781791	5	lennine ratingfive buy the whole thing you won't regret it.
858	1352008781791	5	leneight ratingfive this app has saved me so much time.
859	1352008781791	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i can type fast without worrying what i am typing because it will auto correct and predict what i will say!
860	1352008781791	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive the only thing i'd like to see if the choice to add different themes for the keyboard other than that awesome app guys!
861	1352004361604	5	lenfifteen ratingfive it's so good, hate using my phone keyboard, it's just not the same!
862	1352004361604	5	lenseven ratingfive it's easier, better, and just faster.
863	1352004361604	5	lenseven ratingfive thank you for creating such a keyboard :)
864	1352002398574	4	lenseventeen ratingfour i would have rated it 20/5 stars if we could just shortcut letters or words to other words.
865	1352002398574	4	lenthirteen ratingfour for instance, if i were to type "u" it would automatically put "you."
866	1352002398574	4	lenseven ratingfour and putting "r" would automatically put "are."
867	1352002398574	4	lenthree ratingfour amazing keyboard app.
868	1352001387961	5	lenseven ratingfive saves time and makes writing a pleasure.
869	1352001063628	5	lenthree ratingfive upgraded from trial.
870	1352001063628	5	lennine ratingfive works way better than the stock keyboard on galaxy s3.
871	1352001063628	5	leneight ratingfive also very setting rich-tons of customizing options.
872	1352001063628	5	lentwo ratingfive slide  function.
873	1352001063628	5	lenfive ratingfive i actually love that feature.
874	1352001063628	5	lenseventeen ratingfive well worth paying for imo. :-) most of the 'complaints' are actually fixable by adjusting the settings, jeeze.
875	1352001063628	5	lenseven ratingfive use it before you review it, duh!
876	1351995052386	2	lenfour ratingtwo doesnt work with emoji
877	1351994044020	5	lenthree ratingfive love this keyboard
878	1351993365477	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome app.
879	1351993365477	5	leneight ratingfive been using it since i first downloaded it.
880	1351993365477	5	leneleven ratingfive haven't used the default keyboard on my phone at all.
881	1351988074031	5	lennineteen ratingfive after getting the gsiii i was a little bit unhappy with the stock samsung keyboard and predictive text capabilities.
882	1351988074031	5	lentwelve ratingfive without a doubt this new swiftkey keyboard met and exceeded my requirements.
883	1351988074031	5	lensix ratingfive more efficient and saved me "4000 keystrokes"
884	1351988074031	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i will highly recommend it to anyone with a new phone and i clumsy fingers.
885	1351988074031	5	lenfifteen ratingfive plus the endless personalization, themes, and colors put it over the top in my mind.
886	1351985520300	1	lenthirteen ratingone extremely inaccurate when texting i hate this keyboard wish i could have refund.
887	1351984327004	3	lenthirteen ratingthree would have given this 5 starts if it worked well with king soft office.
888	1351983976588	5	lenseventeen ratingfive love swiftkey been using it for quite a while now by far the best keyboard out there.
889	1351983976588	5	lenthirteen ratingfive hands down has the best predictive capability of any keyboard i've used.
890	1351983976588	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i can literally type garbage and it types exactly what i want 99% of the time.
891	1351983340987	4	lenthirteen ratingfour needs to switch back to abc after typing numbers and pressing space bar.
892	1351983196396	3	lenseven ratingthree sometimes the suggestions don't pop up.
893	1352115407517	5	lenfifteen ratingfive used to hate typing on my htc one x but now it's a pleasure  :-) :-)
894	1352109035197	5	lennine ratingfive this the only app i've ever paid for.
895	1352109035197	5	lenfour ratingfive samsung galaxy keyboard sucks.
896	1352105582368	5	lentwo ratingfive none better
897	1352105314688	2	leneight ratingtwo edit: clearing the cache improves the performance somewhat.
898	1352105314688	2	lenseven ratingtwo but the stock keyboard is still faster.
899	1352105314688	2	lentwentytwo ratingtwo however, now with jellybean 4.1.2 when swift key is selected as default keyboard, it takes quite awhile for the keyboard to open up.
900	1352105314688	2	lenten ratingtwo this delay is gone when i switch to stock keyboard.
901	1352105314688	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo please check and fix this problem as i am used to swift key now.
902	1352102683132	5	lenfifteen ratingfive used to love this ,but recent update has punctuation and prediction bugs gallore .please fix !
903	1352097177128	4	lensix ratingfour love it, love it love it.
904	1352097177128	4	lenthree ratingfour worth every penny!.
905	1352097177128	4	lenfive ratingfour saves time makes life easyer.
906	1352097177128	4	lenfive ratingfour seriously a good keyboard app
907	1352096605136	5	lennineteen ratingfive by far the best keyboard available on the android market, tried it for thirty days and was immediately hooked.
908	1352096605136	5	lentwelve ratingfive never thought i'd pay for an app, very glad i did.
909	1352094276870	4	lenfifteen ratingfour have been using swiftkey for almost a year and it's hands down the best.
910	1352094276870	4	lenfifteen ratingfour however, i can't believe there still isn't support for chinese pin yin typing.
911	1352093715975	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree like it most the time, but so sick of it crashing when i copy/paste or even selecting text can cause it.
912	1352093715975	3	leneighteen ratingthree also hate how hard it is to multiple space after punctuation, and other functions after punctuation as well.
913	1352092239223	4	lensixteen ratingfour works great most of the time just wish keys were a little bigger and more themes
914	1352090708599	5	lensixteen ratingfive i am a recent switch from the iphone and found the droid keyboard to be horrible.
915	1352090708599	5	lentwelve ratingfive this app is a must have if you are an iphone convert.
916	1352090708599	5	lennine ratingfive don't wait a second to buy this one.
917	1352089781713	1	leneight ratingone i can't even download the lanuage packs.
918	1352089781713	1	lenten ratingone if i find a solution i'll change my opinion.
919	1352087369617	5	lennineteen ratingfive this is the best app i have come across i love it never going back to regular keyboard again.
920	1352079169706	4	lentwenty ratingfour i love it but for some reason it's been waiting to have trouble with typing the right letters & symbols.
921	1352079169706	4	lenfive ratingfour also we need more themes!
922	1352078359461	5	leneleven ratingfive after using swype i never thought a keyboard could be better.
923	1352078359461	5	leneleven ratingfive yet after using this after a few weeks i was sold.
924	1352076960699	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i honestly do not know how i have been functioning before this app.
925	1352076960699	5	lenfifteen ratingfive at first i downloaded the trial version to see what all the hype was about.
926	1352076960699	5	lentwo ratingfive unhelpful keyboard!
927	1352076960699	5	lenseventeen ratingfive the layout of the smiley faces and the main punctuation keys just make so much more sense!
928	1352076960699	5	lennine ratingfive had to cough up the 4 bucks for this one.
929	1352076885664	5	lenten ratingfive excellent keyboard, my favorite since i had the original evo.
930	1352076885664	5	lenfive ratingfive using it on my samsung s3.
931	1352075086831	2	lenfive ratingtwo needs better galaxy note 2 support.
932	1352074205411	5	lenthirtyseven ratingfive as people have said, awesome predictive text,  but in addition to that, the interactions are smooth, the typing is much more responsive than stock and it still uses the jelly bean native voice dictation and typo correction.
933	1352074205411	5	lenfive ratingfive my favorite keyboard by far.
934	1352070994999	5	leneighteen ratingfive please add more themes, such as an ability to choose the colors of the keys, letters, and background.
935	1352070994999	5	lensix ratingfive also a bunch more customizable options.
936	1352070994999	5	leneight ratingfive i love being able to customize my phone.
937	1352068313596	1	lenfive ratingone major issues with chrome fields.
938	1352068313596	1	lenseven ratingone jumps all over the place, erases characters.
939	1352068313596	1	lenthree ratingone pretty much unusable.
940	1352067859117	3	lenten ratingthree i love this app, its just missing a few things.
941	1352067859117	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree i just wish it had those hearts like `?` on my galaxy s3, cause thats the only reason i dont use it as often
942	1352064799016	5	lenfive ratingfive best purchase on google play
943	1352064014346	1	lentwentytwo ratingone when it works it's 5* but the constant error message 'unable to load language packs' has annoyed me and made it unusable.
944	1352064014346	1	lenthirteen ratingone deleting the folder in 'sdcard/android/data' only works for about a day.
945	1352061419221	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i also love that if you spam space it will type up a sentence ", and i getting to know if you are doing well.
946	1352061419221	5	lenfive ratingfive i am a beautiful person."
947	1352061419221	5	leneight ratingfive that was typed with only the space bar.
948	1352060402603	2	lentwentyone ratingtwo i used to have five star love swiftkey, but now that i'm on ics, i'm having lots of problems.
949	1352060402603	2	leneight ratingtwo two stars until they get their act together.
950	1352060402757	5	leneight ratingfive the best app i bought for my phone.
951	1352060402757	5	lennine ratingfive it makes typing on a small keyboard really convenient.
952	1352060402757	5	lenthirteen ratingfive since i have it i actually use my phone to write longer texts.
953	1352058416803	5	lenthree ratingfive great android keyboard.
954	1352205190381	2	lenfive ratingtwo when is more themes coming
955	1352204888667	4	leneleven ratingfour auto correct and easy swipe delete make it worth the money
956	1352203520876	5	lennineteen ratingfive been using it since basically day 1 of me on android and couldn't even think of using another keyboard.
957	1352193688185	5	lenfifteen ratingfive swift key is great i can't believe i could use my phone without it.
958	1352189531796	4	lenfive ratingfour text predictions randomly stop working.
959	1352187035768	3	lenseventeen ratingthree this app was a revelation but seems to be worse now than when i first got it.
960	1352187035768	3	lentwentyfour ratingthree the big issue is that it regularly fails to predict very simple words when i omit the space or get just 1 or 2 letters wrong.
961	1352187035768	3	lensixteen ratingthree it's the fact that it's getting simple things so wrong that's the issue.
962	1352187035768	3	lensixteen ratingthree it also seems to have no understanding of concept, which wasn't so in the past.
963	1352187035768	3	lenthirty ratingthree the layout is still brilliant though and it's still a far better option than anything else but it's not as good as it was and improvements are needed.
964	1352185787484	3	lenfifteen ratingthree but i don't understand why i need to pay again for a tablet version.
965	1352184806100	4	leneleven ratingfour first purchase i recommend to all my friends switching to android.
966	1352184806100	4	leneight ratingfour leaps and bounds ahead of stock keyboard on s3.
967	1352184806100	4	lentwelve ratingfour would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for that ".com"
968	1352184806100	4	lennine ratingfour button when you're typing in the address bar.
969	1352184806100	4	lentwelve ratingfour you'll understand when you're using the address bar to search.
970	1352184806100	4	lenten ratingfour every unfocused attempt to click the space bar becomes ".com".
971	1352184806100	4	lentwelve ratingfour fix that and this app is the best in the play store.
972	1352184183871	4	lensix ratingfour great app, helps a heeps load.
973	1352184183871	4	leneight ratingfour add more themes, then i'll be satisfied.
974	1352183279793	1	lentwentytwo ratingone it's been months since hundreds if not thousands of users faithfully and trustingly waiting for the additional of chinese language support.
975	1352183279793	1	lenten ratingone but with more languages added,chinese never made the list.
976	1352183279793	1	lenten ratingone i am sick of how paid users are being treated.
977	1352183279793	1	lentwenty ratingone yes you may have made my money, but rest assure i will never ever recommend this app to anyone else.
978	1352183279793	1	lentwentyfour ratingone and to all other who is considering getting this app, if you like to be ignored then this is the right app for you.
979	1352181413089	5	lenfifteen ratingfive is that i can adjust the timing on the hold-key-to-get-symbol-feature.
980	1352181413089	5	leneight ratingfive i can insert numbers and symbols in 0.2 seconds!
981	1352180894074	5	lentwenty ratingfive once you'll try it, you will feel the urge to stop using the trial to have the complete version.
982	1352177957407	5	lenten ratingfive whatever the problem was, it appears to have been fixed.
983	1352177957407	5	lenthree ratingfive this keyboard rocks!
984	1352177229244	3	leneleven ratingthree love the keyboard but i frequently get "cannot load language packs"
985	1352177229244	3	lenfive ratingthree big pain in the rear.
986	1352176949418	1	lensixteen ratingone there is a bug on function and shift buttons on physical keyboards with cm9 on this version.
987	1352176949418	1	lensixteen ratingone works fine with swiftkey x. i love it but it makes the physical keyboard nearly unuseable.
988	1352176949418	1	leneight ratingone once its fixed a solid 5 stars from me.
989	1352174902266	5	lensix ratingfive typing this review using swiftkey currently.
990	1352174902266	5	lensixteen ratingfive it's exponentially better than the standard keyboard on my sensation 4g and i like the customization.
991	1352174902266	5	lenten ratingfive one of the few apps i don't regret purchasing.
992	1352174902266	5	lentwo ratingfive great app!
993	1352171288104	5	leneleven ratingfive i'd marry it if i had to marry a keyboard.
994	1352170621022	5	leneleven ratingfive this made me not regret trading my iphone for the droid.
995	1352170621022	5	lenthirteen ratingfive couldn't type with the samsung keyboard but this app makes it awesome.
996	1352169932980	5	lensix ratingfive my only issue is lack themes!
997	1352169932980	5	lenfour ratingfive please add way more .
998	1352169612573	5	lenthirteen ratingfive love the app except for trying to enter form data and numerical predictions!
999	1352169612573	5	lentwelve ratingfive it locks on a combination and makes it nearly impossible to correct.
1000	1352168000715	3	lentwelve ratingthree i have been waiting for chinese input for more than a year.
1001	1352168000715	3	lennine ratingthree even swype has chinese pinyin for quite a while.
1002	1352168000715	3	leneleven ratingthree swiftkey need to cater for more market and introduce chinese asap.
1003	1352167263589	3	leneleven ratingthree why are smileys not long press on txt and chat apps?
1004	1352165790907	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i have even tried the android 4.2 apk keyboard and this one is better.
1005	1352164684803	5	leneleven ratingfive i use this app more than any other app i have.
1006	1352164684803	5	leneight ratingfive it's uncanny how intuitive this app is.
1007	1352164684803	5	lennine ratingfive definitely speeds up typing on these tiny key boards.
1008	1352164684803	5	leneight ratingfive it's worth every cent and then some!
1009	1352162493631	1	lenten ratingone the app works fine then all of a sudden nothing.
1010	1352162493631	1	lenseven ratingone again, reinstalled 4 times in the last 3 days.
1011	1352162005018	5	lenthree ratingfive small learning curve.
1012	1352162005018	5	lenseven ratingfive the best $4 bucks i've ever spent.
1013	1352156107729	3	lenfive ratingthree still waiting on japanese support.
1014	1352156107729	3	lennineteen ratingthree that's the only reason i don't use this keyboard all the time; my current keyboard supports japanese
1015	1352155698814	1	lensixteen ratingone every time the phone restarts i have to go and set the keyboard to swift key.
1016	1352155698814	1	lentwo ratingone pretty annoying
1017	1352290596679	5	lenfive ratingfive terrific app,worth the 4 bucks!
1018	1352281780216	5	lensix ratingfive 5 stars, best app i ever purchased
1019	1352277498146	1	lensixteen ratingone every time the phone restarts you have to manually change it back to swiftkey, fix plox.
1020	1352276074078	4	lenthree ratingfour just ok app
1021	1352274380467	5	lennine ratingfive the default keyboard on the samsung galaxy s3 is terrible!
1022	1352274380467	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i almost returned the phone until i found this swiftkey replacement for the keyboard.
1023	1352274380467	5	lennine ratingfive i can type really fast with great accuracy now!
1024	1352274118818	4	lenseventeen ratingfour this app would be perfect if i could toggle none-to-all auto-correction features on/off.
1025	1352274118818	4	lentwentyseven ratingfour for example, if i could turn off space after punctuation, or turn off the automatic removal of a space when typing a question mark, and so on.
1026	1352274118818	4	lennineteen ratingfour this keyboard has great dictionary support but has way too many auto-correct features to be all-round useful.
1027	1352274118818	4	lenseventeen ratingfour it's sad that i have to disable the keyboard from time to time out of frustration.
1028	1352272471155	5	lennineteen ratingfive must have but it will be much better if there is an option not to learn from specific files.
1029	1352269964697	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this keyboard.
1030	1352269964697	5	lenten ratingfive i just wish there were more themes to choose from.
1031	1352267022464	1	lenthirteen ratingone the app is awesome when it's actually predicting and correcting your typing.
1032	1352267022464	1	lenfourteen ratingone but it's quite often that the prediction tab across the top is inactive.
1033	1352267022464	1	leneight ratingone in these situations predictive text does not work.
1034	1352267022464	1	leneleven ratingone and typing is tediously slow having to correct nearly every word!
1035	1352266287087	5	lensix ratingfive makes texting so so much easier.
1036	1352266287087	5	leneighteen ratingfive coming from an iphone the messaging on my s3 was hard till i was told to download this app.
1037	1352266287087	5	lenten ratingfive fantastic and better then any other texting i've used.
1038	1352266038370	3	lentwentyone ratingthree plz fix to where the keys will respond to ppl that types fast it freezes alot n im a quick txter
1039	1352264544168	5	lenten ratingfive best keyboard i have used, muuuch better than the s3 standard.
1040	1352264544168	5	lensix ratingfive predictions are really useful (and accurate).
1041	1352259334988	1	leneight ratingone still can't seem to do multitouch correctly.
1042	1352259334988	1	lenthirteen ratingone they get detected as swipes and delete words and hide the keyboard randomly.
1043	1352258454068	5	lenseven ratingfive thank you very much for your app!
1044	1352257996782	5	lenfour ratingfive best i've found.
1045	1352257996782	5	lentwo ratingfive htc desire
1046	1352257654406	5	lenthree ratingfive add more themes!
1047	1352256979442	4	leneleven ratingfour the app is one app away from being a must have.
1048	1352256979442	4	lenten ratingfour unfortunately, the keyboard is simply not visible when using chrome.
1049	1352256615480	5	lentwelve ratingfive it keeps getting better at predicting and correcting my messages/tweets/updates.
1050	1352256093633	4	lenthirteen ratingfour seems somewhat laggy after jelly bean as well as not predicting as much.
1051	1352254678815	3	lenten ratingthree i deleted because you can't take off auto-correct
1052	1352254032745	4	lenthree ratingfour fast and easy
1053	1352250195003	4	lennine ratingfour awesome keyboard but lacks pen detection for note ii.
1054	1352250195003	4	lenthirtythree ratingfour please include this in the next update :d its a bit of a hassle to keep on changing between this and stock keyboard when i want to use the s-pen thanks :d
1055	1352248828587	5	lensixteen ratingfive i have the severist form of an autoimmune joint disease that makes it difficult to text.
1056	1352248828587	5	lensix ratingfive im young too, so it sucks.
1057	1352248828587	5	leneighteen ratingfive this app adds to the quality of my life by recognizing my text style and remembering my words.
1058	1352247755347	4	lenthree ratingfour fantastic word predictions.
1059	1352247755347	4	leneight ratingfour lost a star for the occasional stability issue.
1060	1352247755347	4	lensix ratingfour this happens around once a month.
1061	1352247164428	5	lennine ratingfive i have a galaxy s3 and hate the samsung keyboard.
1062	1352247164428	5	lenten ratingfive so i got this keyboard and i absolutely love it!
1063	1352247164428	5	lensix ratingfive wish there was more themes though.
1064	1352246045794	5	lentwentythree ratingfive my spelling and texting isint soo great so is very useful, find it amazing how it is starting to learn how i text.
1065	1352245728623	5	lenfour ratingfive this keyboard is amazing.
1066	1352245728623	5	lensix ratingfive it's like science fiction good.
1067	1352245728623	5	lensixteen ratingfive near perfect accuracy for smart space, learns everything and predicts like it's reading my mind!
1068	1352245728623	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i can type whole emails without even having to spell out a single word.
1069	1352245728623	5	lennine ratingfive i just tap the sentences out from the predictions.
1070	1352241559829	2	leneight ratingtwo .but after last update it's total crap!
1071	1352241559829	2	leneighteen ratingtwo i'm using croatian layout and we used to have croatian letters underneath regular i.e. long press.
1072	1352241559829	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo now there are 5 croatian letters at most right making all keys unbelievably tiny!
1073	1352241559829	2	lennine ratingtwo and i don't want to type in landscape.
1074	1352241559829	2	lenseventeen ratingtwo if you can't fix this (that ? is under c, ? is under z, etc) please refund me.
1075	1352241559829	2	lentwelve ratingtwo i'm sorry for one star, but this is completely your fault.
1076	1352379101590	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this is a very awesome keyboard with very accurate prediction, i love it very much.
1077	1352379101590	5	lennine ratingfive but please add chinese language support, really need it.
1078	1352378117011	5	lenthree ratingfive fantastic keyboard app.
1079	1352361272016	2	lenfive ratingtwo now constantly crashing on ics
1080	1352359509666	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this app knows what i'm gonna type next just like a soulmate.
1081	1352359509666	5	leneight ratingfive bought it after using the demo for 2 weeks.
1082	1352359509666	5	lenseven ratingfive great value and a real time saver.
1083	1352357156756	5	lennine ratingfive blown away at how accurate and predictive it is.
1084	1352357156756	5	lennineteen ratingfive i just finished the trial, but knew after the first day that i would be purchasing the full version.
1085	1352353602093	4	lentwenty ratingfour wish it could shift the keypad to one side so that those with bigger phones could type with one hand
1086	1352353126678	5	lensix ratingfive the original s3 keyboard is an embarrassment.
1087	1352353126678	5	lenseven ratingfive swiftkey is intuitive and makes typing enjoyable.
1088	1352353126678	5	lensix ratingfive i wish it had trace however.
1089	1352351157668	5	leneight ratingfive much better than stock ics its crazy yo
1090	1352349474736	5	lenfour ratingfive best keyboard hands down!
1091	1352349474736	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive predictions are scary accurate and i just i just got a notification telling me that i've saved myself over 10,000 key strokes.
1092	1352347793266	5	leneleven ratingfive i finally have a keyboard that i like & love to use!
1093	1352347793266	5	lensixteen ratingfive it does take a day to configure it the way you want it, but after that.
1094	1352346895583	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i never thought i'd be really ready to give up my physical keyboard from my smartphone.
1095	1352346895583	5	lenfour ratingfive this keyboard changes that.
1096	1352346895583	5	lentwenty ratingfive i tried swype and it was good, but i hated trying type words and the accidently swyping and messing up.
1097	1352346895583	5	lenfive ratingfive the prediction engine is awesome.
1098	1352346871733	5	lentwo ratingfive brilliant keyboard.
1099	1352346871733	5	lenthree ratingfive waiting for flow.
1100	1352346871733	5	leneleven ratingfive add learn word prediction from whatsapp and viber for better predictions.
1101	1352345527045	5	lenseven ratingfive makes texting easy well worth the money
1102	1352343976923	5	lentwenty ratingfive this was the first third party keyboard i tried on android and the one all the others are measured against.
1103	1352343976923	5	lensix ratingfive and none of them measure up.
1104	1352343976923	5	leneighteen ratingfive some are getting close but then a swiftkey update comes along and leave them back in the dust.
1105	1352343976923	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this is the only who's predictions and corrections i really trust without looking back.
1106	1352343341138	3	lentwenty ratingthree makes me make lot's of typos and if i tilt it i can't see all what i type.
1107	1352343341138	3	lenthirteen ratingthree extremely annoying if it wasnt for the multilingual, i would've deleted it.
1108	1352343029633	5	lennine ratingfive great keyboard and it make my typing so easy.
1109	1352342930381	1	lenten ratingone i've had this app for a long long time.
1110	1352342930381	1	lenfive ratingone and i truly love it.
1111	1352342930381	1	lensix ratingone it also looks and feel awesome!
1112	1352342930381	1	lenten ratingone every time that i type, or am about to type.
1113	1352342930381	1	lenten ratingone in my notifications bar, a little keyboard thing pops up.
1114	1352342930381	1	lenseventeen ratingone it says "select keyboard input.", the only problem with that is that i have already chose swiftkey!
1115	1352342930381	1	lensix ratingone i have tried it like 1thousand times!
1116	1352342930381	1	lentwentyfour ratingone it really hurts me to give you a one star for this amazing app, but could you please at least attempt to fix it?
1117	1352342887618	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree when i type an email in outlook or gmail, this program does not allow me to delete commas, question marks or periods.
1118	1352342887618	3	lenfourteen ratingthree love the product otherwise but this will cause me to stop using the product.
1119	1352342887618	3	lenfive ratingthree i have an lg spectrum.
1120	1352335993438	1	lenthree ratingone need more themes.
1121	1352335993438	1	lentwo ratingone need t9 input
1122	1352335105698	1	lenthirteen ratingone worked fine for a while, but some update broke it completely for me.
1123	1352335105698	1	leneighteen ratingone my use case: type something and select one of the three suggestions on the top of the keyboard.
1124	1352335105698	1	lennineteen ratingone in my scenario (three languages, de/en_us/he) this fails a lot (i think mostly with german words).
1125	1352335105698	1	lennineteen ratingone type something, select the completion and the current text isn't replaced with the selected word, but removed entirely.
1126	1352335105698	1	lennineteen ratingone combining multiple languages in one keyboard (one for de/en_us instead of two different) is crap as well.
1127	1352334866932	3	lenten ratingthree wasn't a believer at first. .but now i am!
1128	1352334261100	3	lenseven ratingthree this does not have the numeric keys.
1129	1352334261100	3	lensix ratingthree the orininal keyboard has numeric keyboard
1130	1352331366047	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive when i wiped my phone, the few days i didn't have this installed i just wouldn't type much because it was such a hassle compare to the fantastic ease when i use swiftkey
1131	1352329400620	5	lenthirteen ratingfive wonderful keyboard and way better than the one that came on my default.
1132	1352328670234	5	lenfourteen ratingfive nice app much easier and quicker than standard keyboard, and the predictions are great.
1133	1352326290359	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard app i have used.
1134	1352326290359	5	lenseventeen ratingfive the samsung keyboard kept crashing and the swipe kept registering strange finger taps that didn't happen.
1135	1352326249121	5	lenseven ratingfive the default keyboard on my device sucks.
1136	1352326249121	5	lennine ratingfive i spent more time fighting with it then typing.
1137	1352326249121	5	lensix ratingfive and i also use multiple languages.
1138	1352326249121	5	lentwelve ratingfive this application made a huge difference and is well worth the money.
1139	1352324825817	5	lenfive ratingfive thanks for letting me know!
1140	1352324825817	5	lenfive ratingfive how to disable automatic correction.
1141	1352324825817	5	lentwo ratingfive excellent keyboard.
1142	1352462285534	3	lenfifteen ratingthree there are no predictions given when typing in any of the browsers i have installed.
1143	1352457115734	5	lenfive ratingfive i absolutely love this keyboard.
1144	1352457115734	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive i bought 3 days after trying the trial version but the only thing i'd love to see is if they can remove the + and the - and all those shortcuts from the.
1145	1352457115734	5	lentwo ratingfive typing keyboard.
1146	1352457115734	5	lennine ratingfive it'll just make a cleaner more attractive look!
1147	1352457114698	5	lenseven ratingfive the most efficient typing application out there.
1148	1352457114698	5	lensix ratingfive love the predictions and auto-corrections.
1149	1352457114698	5	lenfive ratingfive typing is a breeze now.
1150	1352457114698	5	lenfour ratingfive totally worth the price.
1151	1352457114698	5	lensix ratingfive hope it supports chinese typing soon.
1152	1352455672510	1	lentwelve ratingone i have a samsung galaxy s2 that was constantly crashing, amongst other problems.
1153	1352455672510	1	lenfifteen ratingone it went off for a repair and came back perfect until i installed swiftkey 3 again.
1154	1352455672510	1	lennine ratingone i emailed the devs but never got a response.
1155	1352455672510	1	lennine ratingone very disappointed that i wasted my money on this!
1156	1352455672510	1	lentwelve ratingone swiftkey also kept deleting words as i was typing for no reason.
1157	1352455672510	1	lentwentythree ratingone scoured the boards but couldn't find anything and emailed the devs over this issue too and again didn't get a reply.
1158	1352452562297	5	leneleven ratingfive easily better than the default keyboard, and arguably better than swype.
1159	1352452562297	5	lenten ratingfive the learning and word predictions work better than you think!
1160	1352451052976	5	lennineteen ratingfive it makes it super easy to text in english then portugu¨ºs without having to switch to a completely different keyboard.
1161	1352447853985	5	lenfour ratingfive juz love this keyboard!
1162	1352447853985	5	lenfive ratingfive save me sooo much time!
1163	1352447853985	5	lennine ratingfive however, i can't type chinese characters with it.
1164	1352447730570	5	lenfive ratingfive saves me time every day.
1165	1352447730570	5	lenfifteen ratingfive predictions work very good and overall very solid app with lots of options and customization.
1166	1352447730570	5	lentwo ratingfive thanks dev.
1167	1352439176338	2	lenthree ratingtwo huge battery drain
1168	1352438305009	4	lenten ratingfour the portrait mode doesn't give me a predictions anymore.
1169	1352438305009	4	lensixteen ratingfour i tried to get in touch with you but no one is geting back to me.
1170	1352438000229	4	lenseven ratingfour its awesome just wish it had emojis
1171	1352431479970	5	lensix ratingfive i cannot recommend this keyboard enough.
1172	1352431479970	5	lensixteen ratingfive i type so much faster with all the predictions which are accurate more often than not.
1173	1352431479970	5	leneighteen ratingfive there are some small tweaks here and there that also just make it 10x better and easier to use.
1174	1352430883240	3	lenfive ratingthree plesse add in chinese keyboard.
1175	1352430490980	1	lentwenty ratingone so when i am typing a text, the auto correct lags behind then inserts the mistake repeatedly back to back.
1176	1352430490980	1	lensixteen ratingone not only that, but by the time it catches up, it has already sent the message.
1177	1352430490980	1	lensixteen ratingone additionally, in the chrome browser the keyboard won't let me type in the appropriate space.
1178	1352430490980	1	lensixteen ratingone it starts in the middle of a word or some place random that makes no sense.
1179	1352430490980	1	lennine ratingone i can't believe i paid for this keyboard.
1180	1352430490980	1	lenten ratingone it is truly the worst keyboard ever on a galaxy s3.
1181	1352430490980	1	lennine ratingone i hate it and i want my money back.
1182	1352429916976	1	lenten ratingone i've had this app for a long long time.
1183	1352429916976	1	lenfive ratingone and i truly love it.
1184	1352429916976	1	lensix ratingone it also looks and feel awesome!
1185	1352429916976	1	lenten ratingone every time that i type, or am about to type.
1186	1352429916976	1	lenten ratingone in my notifications bar, a little keyboard thing pops up.
1187	1352429916976	1	lenseventeen ratingone it says "select keyboard input.", the only problem with that is that i have already chose swiftkey!
1188	1352429916976	1	lensix ratingone i have tried it like 1thousand times!
1189	1352429916976	1	lentwentyfour ratingone it really hurts me to give you a one star for this amazing app, but could you please at least attempt to fix it?
1190	1352429647478	5	lenfourteen ratingfive very awesome.seriously need a personal dictionary mode for shortcuts besides that 9 of 10 peoplerecommend
1191	1352429139026	5	lenfour ratingfive best i've found.
1192	1352429139026	5	lentwo ratingfive htc desire
1193	1352428300252	5	lensix ratingfive only for swiftkey to break it.
1194	1352428300252	5	lentwentyone ratingfive since it is really the one thing that sets them apart from the rest of the other keyboard apps out there.
1195	1352427351303	3	lentwentyfive ratingthree like just about every aspect other than that the keyboard lags when i type fast and occasionally freezes for a few seconds at a time.
1196	1352424130817	4	lenten ratingfour keyboard just wished there were more emoticons to choose from.
1197	1352423890910	2	lensix ratingtwo predict row gone after switching tasks.
1198	1352423890910	2	leneight ratingtwo backspace on auto correct doesn't undo correction.
1199	1352423890910	2	leneight ratingtwo long press predict doesn't have similar words.
1200	1352423450328	5	leneight ratingfive this is way better than the stock gs3 keyboard.
1201	1352422471306	4	lenthirteen ratingfour but i loved the free trial of this keyboard so i bought it!
1202	1352422471306	4	lenfive ratingfour best keyboard i've used!
1203	1352422026142	5	lenfive ratingfive there is no better keyboard.
1204	1352422026142	5	lenten ratingfive predictions so good i let go of a hard keyboard.
1205	1352893562435	5	lentwelve ratingfive works perfect with htc wildfire fantastic keyboard thank you very much 5 stars
1206	1352892643709	5	lenfive ratingfive best app in the world
1207	1352890835502	5	lentwo ratingfive brilliant application
1208	1352889901178	5	lentwenty ratingfive i have used this for more than about a year now and it's simply awesome nothing can beat this
1209	1352888574952	2	lennine ratingtwo would love to have it on my pc desktop.
1210	1352888574952	2	leneleven ratingtwo but it makes my browser crash allmost everytime i use it.
1211	1352888574952	2	leneleven ratingtwo it's so annoying that i tried to live without it.
1212	1352888574952	2	leneighteen ratingtwo but it's impossible once you've get used to type only the firts letter of each word.
1213	1352886966292	1	lenseven ratingone still no option to disable swipe gestures!
1214	1352886966292	1	leneleven ratingone this was an option at one point, why was it removed?
1215	1352886966292	1	lennineteen ratingone this keyboard is useless with swipe gestures enabled as typing even slightly fast causes you to accidentally delete words.
1216	1352886904808	5	leneighteen ratingfive my first ever comment for an app and i'm doing so because of unbelievable utility of swiftkey.
1217	1352886904808	5	lenfourteen ratingfive my inbox is inundated with constant emails and texts which require an immediate response.
1218	1352886904808	5	lentwentysix ratingfive the samsung keypad had it's advantages but i would still be keen to get things done faster which led me to download the trial version.
1219	1352886904808	5	lentwentythree ratingfive what struck a chord was the ability of the app to predict my own next word before i've even thought of it.
1220	1352886904808	5	lenseventeen ratingfive a few emails later and now i'm even writing a review which should speak for itself.
1221	1352882922410	5	lenfourteen ratingfive really love the keyboard but new update changed layout for the worse for me.
1222	1352882922410	5	lenseventeen ratingfive no longer places apostrophes in i'm (it just types im or tries to correct to in).
1223	1352882922410	5	lennine ratingfive no easy press for exclamation mark and question mark.
1224	1352882922410	5	leneight ratingfive takes me longer to type stuff than before.
1225	1352882922410	5	lenfour ratingfive new update sorted it.
1226	1352882144096	4	lenfifteen ratingfour great except every time the phone turns off it resets to the default samsung keyboard.
1227	1352882007849	3	lennine ratingthree any reason why i can't load language packs?
1228	1352882007849	3	lenfour ratingthree makes this application useless.
1229	1352878114669	4	leneight ratingfour very easy to use, and real nice layout.
1230	1352878114669	4	lenfifteen ratingfour but, can you please add options to choose if i want the words prediction bar!
1231	1352878114669	4	lenthirteen ratingfour also if i could also customize some punctuation buttons in the main keyboard.
1232	1352874636872	5	lenthirteen ratingfive love it.after the trial expired, i realised i couldnt do without it.
1233	1352873981554	4	lensix ratingfour even for missing tons of letters.
1234	1352873981554	4	lenfourteen ratingfour especially love that you can keep texting and it separates the words for you.
1235	1352873981554	4	lentwentyone ratingfour however, i do wish that there for maybe 4 or 5 instead of just 3 words that popped up for you to choose from.
1236	1352873981554	4	lenthirty ratingfour the new swype beta offers as many as it can fit which is nice and that's why i used it, cause it had swype and accurate predictions(more than 3).
1237	1352873981554	4	lenten ratingfour hopefully swiftkey flow will bring something like that to compete.
1238	1352870153778	1	leneleven ratingone fix the chrome freeze and crash that happens only when using swiftkey3.
1239	1352870153778	1	lenseven ratingone p.s. all apps up to date.
1240	1352864847240	4	lennine ratingfour this keyboard is much better than the average keyboard.
1241	1352864576235	2	lentwenty ratingtwo some apps result in swiftkey replacing the enter key with the smiley key as primary and long press as enter.
1242	1352864576235	2	lennineteen ratingtwo if there was an option to remove the smiley and leave as enter this wouldn't be an issue.
1243	1352864576235	2	leneight ratingtwo this ends up being a nuisance when typing.
1244	1352864576235	2	lenfive ratingtwo (same issue on tablet version)
1245	1352864147236	5	lenten ratingfive its a great app but its not working for tumblr.
1246	1352864147236	5	lenseven ratingfive can i get some developer support pls?
1247	1352863414825	5	lenseven ratingfive one thing is need more theme's!.
1248	1352862507315	5	leneleven ratingfive i'm dumb as a rock when it comes to spelling .
1249	1352862507315	5	leneight ratingfive swiftkey makes me text like a college professor.
1250	1352862369560	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive the prediction of the words is crazy, like i will make a massive typo and it will know what i ment totally worth the bucks
1251	1352861864891	5	lenfive ratingfive prediction works like a charm
1252	1352859852048	5	lenseven ratingfive work's like a charm, amazing product!
1253	1352859455579	5	lensixteen ratingfive this is the most accurate keyboard application i've used and it gets increasingly more accurate.
1254	1352859455579	5	leneight ratingfive the predictions are surprisingly accurate in 'rapid' style.
1255	1352859455579	5	lensix ratingfive i very much recommend buying this.
1256	1352859455579	5	lentwelve ratingfive i just wish the '?' was a long press on the 'm' key.
1257	1352858300948	4	lenthree ratingfour worth the price.
1258	1352858300948	4	lenfour ratingfour the s3 keyboard is horrible.
1259	1352858061457	5	lentwenty ratingfive didn't think i'd find a keyboard on android to rival the iphone's, but this is even better.
1260	1352858061457	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive my only gripe with it is that you can't do the double tap the space bar thing to add a period.
1261	1352857880255	1	lenfortyseven ratingone it freezes when ever i try and search something that on the search engine and when it does freeze i press the home and when i do get home it the keyboard is still there and i can't get rid of it and it happens frequently.
1262	1352857604172	5	lensixteen ratingfive crazy that a third party app works better than the keyboard that came on my phone.
1263	1352857604172	5	lenfive ratingfive very comparable to iphone keyboard.
1264	1352855307952	5	lenseven ratingfive this keyboard brings my galaxy s3 to life.
1265	1352855307952	5	leneighteen ratingfive i came from having a physical keyboard to this, and it feels even better than that to me!
1266	1352855307952	5	lenseven ratingfive love the new predictive capabilities the most.
1267	1352854938561	1	lensix ratingone unable to turn off predictive text
1268	1352853592071	5	lenfourteen ratingfive much better than my galxcy 3 keyboard.this is a great app and works flawlessly.
1269	1352851133159	4	lentwentyeight ratingfour very good fixes most of my words tht i got wrong sometimes it does some crazy words the one thing i wish they did was have more themes
1270	1352850305497	5	lennine ratingfive this is the best keyboard i've ever used.
1271	1352849914327	5	lentwentyone ratingfive trying to go back to the old keyboard or even trying other keyboards was just impossible after getting used to this.
1272	1352849914327	5	lenseven ratingfive it's amazing and i love it!
1273	1352846900684	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i do wish there was some kind of swyping input as well though.
1274	1352846808575	5	lensix ratingfive absolutely excellent text prediction and layout.
1275	1352846808575	5	lentwentyone ratingfive not sure if user input forum will be as fast for responses as apps with less huge user base will see.
1276	1352846808575	5	leneleven ratingfive add shorter landscape keyboard and it'll be perfect for me
1277	1352843962752	5	lenseven ratingfive so much better then the standard keyboard
1278	1352842558717	5	lenfive ratingfive best one i've tried.
1279	1352842376596	5	leneleven ratingfive just wrote a review on the free version of this app.
1280	1352842376596	5	lentwentythree ratingfive think it's a brilliant app can't fault it in any way, as soon as my free version expired i immediately upgraded.
1281	1352842316370	5	leneight ratingfive this keyboard is the boss of all keyboards.
1282	1352842316370	5	lenten ratingfive just hope they continue to make it more battery efficient.
1283	1352842216625	5	lenfive ratingfive amazing and i love it
1284	1352842199236	5	lentwelve ratingfive after updating to android 4.2, i had to download and install it again.
1285	1352837862784	5	lenfive ratingfive fixes all my tying mistakes.
1286	1352837862784	5	lenseven ratingfive hard to go back to stock keyboards
1287	1352836972513	5	lensixteen ratingfive i tried a lot of keyboards including swype, slide it &  touch, swiftkey is easily the best.
1288	1352836972513	5	lenthirteen ratingfive although i do like swype swiftkey is way more accurate and learns better.
1289	1352835794379	4	leneight ratingfour much better than previous swiftkey keyboard, very accurate!
1290	1352828970682	5	lentwentysix ratingfive trust me when i say, i have had this application since it came out, and it gets better with every update if that is even possible!
1291	1352828680921	5	lentwo ratingfive simply amazing!
1292	1352828680921	5	lenfourteen ratingfive wish it had more themes due to the fact that it was paid for.
1293	1352828680921	5	lennine ratingfive but besides that by far the best keyboard out
1294	1352826764701	4	lenseven ratingfour man kann das grossschreiben nicht komplett abstellen.
1295	1352826764701	4	lenten ratingfour in chats etc. neige ich dazu alle wörter klein zu schreiben.
1296	1352826764701	4	lennine ratingfour swiftkey korrigiert aber alle wörter zwingend komplett inklusive gross/kleinschreibung.
1297	1352825104764	5	leneight ratingfive every other keyboard is a headache by comparison.
1298	1352820763127	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour i tried the trial version and i dont like using anyother keyboard nw. frm now on its only goin to be swiftkey 3
1299	1352820393175	5	lensix ratingfive this thing auto corrects like jedi.
1300	1352820393175	5	lensixteen ratingfive it's genuinely suppressing just how accurately its able to decipher my poorly executed key-mashing.
1301	1352819570282	5	lentwelve ratingfive i've used many keyboards and this one is simply the best.
1302	1352819570282	5	lenthirteen ratingfive in fact, this is the first purchase i've made on google play.
1303	1352819570282	5	lenfifteen ratingfive the prediction is vastly better than anything i've used, and it only gets better.
1304	1352819570282	5	lenten ratingfive sometimes it predicts whole sentences one word at a time.
1305	1352819570282	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive when the free trial expired i tried another keyboard (go keyboard), and while it was decent, it couldn't compare with swiftkey.
1306	1352819570282	5	lentwo ratingfive great app!
1307	1352813031155	5	lenfour ratingfive but no chinese input.
1308	1352813031155	5	lenten ratingfive would be really good if you guys could include that.
1309	1352808227340	1	lentwentyfive ratingone terrible upgrade, the best thing about this app was the predictive text and now you just have punctuation options after each tines you press space.
1310	1352808227340	1	lenfifteen ratingone also tge new predictive guessing long words when you have only pressed 2 keys is ridiculous.
1311	1352808227340	1	lensixteen ratingone if i press 2 letters near t and o then press space i shouldn't get time. .
1312	1352807331383	4	lentwelve ratingfour the keyboard works stunningly well with predictions and rapid typists like myself.
1313	1352807331383	4	lenthirtysix ratingfour the only issues i've come across are text not displaying in the box when i type on occasion (which could be my launcher conflicting with my text messaging app) and the lack of visual customization.
1314	1352805949369	5	lenfour ratingfive predictive text made easy
1315	1352805916993	5	lentwo ratingfive nice program :-)
1316	1352802730564	2	lensixteen ratingtwo loved this app but i'm finding lots of errors when using it with my note 2.
1317	1352802730564	2	lentwelve ratingtwo screens don't pop up the predictive bar randomly disappears please fix
1318	1352801980362	4	lentwo ratingfour wonderful keyboard.
1319	1352801980362	4	lenfive ratingfour turns gibberish into proper words.
1320	1352801980362	4	lennine ratingfour will gladly give 5 stars if two features are added.
1321	1352801980362	4	leneleven ratingfour 1, an option to add/remove words from the dictionary is present.
1322	1352801980362	4	lenfourteen ratingfour the current method for word learning requires a few uses of the desired word.
1323	1352801980362	4	lenfourteen ratingfour 2, a backup feature, so i don't lose my dictionary when i migrate phones.
1324	1352799207950	4	lenthirtyone ratingfour i am looking forward that swiftkey can develop the simplified cangjie input method quickly =] if it has simplified cangjie input method, i will give swiftkey 5 stars, make an all-out effort.
1325	1352799092532	4	lensix ratingfour 5 stars once you get thai keyboard!
1326	1352799092532	4	leneight ratingfour oh and plz add a hide keyboard button.
1327	1352793036494	5	lensix ratingfive very quick and easy to controll.
1328	1352793036494	5	lensix ratingfive plus like the look and feel.
1329	1352786483577	5	lenfour ratingfive just love this keyboard.
1330	1352785285222	1	lenfour ratingone chinese simplified input please~~
1331	1352781396017	5	lenfour ratingfive extremely accurate and customizable.
1332	1352781396017	5	lennine ratingfive and when i say accurate i mean crazy accurate.
1333	1352781396017	5	lenseventeen ratingfive the predictions are crazy good, especially after a while because it learns words that you commonly use.
1334	1352781396017	5	lentwelve ratingfive i also love the shins and ability to fine tune haptic feedback.
1335	1352781396017	5	lennine ratingfive there isn't even a comparable keyboard out there.
1336	1352781396017	5	leneighteen ratingfive compared to swift key, go keyboard, stock keyboard, and all the other sit on the market is trash.
1337	1352781396017	5	lenfive ratingfive this is the real deal
1338	1352779808651	5	lenfour ratingfive worth paying for it.
1339	1352779292339	5	lentwenty ratingfive it's so good that it was actually one of the main reasons i switched back to android from ios.
1340	1352772448032	5	lenseven ratingfive way better than the basic android keyboard
1341	1352771226062	3	lenten ratingthree great app but it crashes often in chrome for me.
1342	1352771226062	3	lenthirteen ratingthree usually on the google homepage the keyboard freezes and stays on the screen.
1343	1352771226062	3	leneleven ratingthree the chrome issues are so frustrating because otherwise it's excellent.
1344	1352770553487	1	lenfour ratingone had trial finally upgraded.
1345	1352770553487	1	leneighteen ratingone keyboard lags, backspace only works till first letter of word then wont work, and swipe back causes errors.
1346	1352767721113	5	lenfour ratingfive swiftkey keyboard is amazing!
1347	1352764495386	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i love it. :-) it is amazing the best application on the market can type a whole sentence with just one finger!
1348	1352763880923	5	lenfour ratingfive the best keyboard available.
1349	1352763880923	5	lennine ratingfive saved me over 40% of my key strokes in 6 months.
1350	1352761472969	4	lennineteen ratingfour like my title says, this could really use the ability to learn from google voice, otherwise very good app!
1351	1352760218957	5	lenthree ratingfive totally worth buying!
1352	1352760120922	4	lentwenty ratingfour awesome app, great improvement from the original sgs3 keyboard but i would love to have the swipe text and writing capability.
1353	1352760120922	4	lenfour ratingfour please add for 5 stars
1354	1352759791949	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i love this app, this is better than original one for samsung galaxy s3.
1355	1352759293397	2	lentwentythree ratingtwo i know swiftkey wants to look hip and cool by adding a slide feature, but if i wanted sliding, i'd use slideit.
1356	1352759293397	2	leneight ratingtwo increasing the spacebar real estate is completely useless.
1357	1352759293397	2	lensixteen ratingtwo i barely use the spacebar, because a space is automatically added when you insert a prediction.
1358	1352759293397	2	lennineteen ratingtwo not everyone is using an s2 or new model phone, sliding is very unreliable on my older lg optimus one p500.
1359	1352759293397	2	lennineteen ratingtwo i get a question mark half the time and my sliding left to delete works only 10% of the time.
1360	1352759293397	2	lennine ratingtwo please allow us to customize the spacebar real estate.
1361	1352759293397	2	lenseven ratingtwo let us enable the question mark key.
1362	1352759293397	2	lennine ratingtwo i'd even recommend adding a smiley face key.
1363	1352759293397	2	lenseventeen ratingtwo as i said, space bar is barely used in this app, don't give it any love.
1364	1352757521638	5	lenfifteen ratingfive amazing :-d it makes it easy for me and makes my typing so much faster!
1365	1352755529932	5	leneight ratingfive sometimes i think swiftkey is reading my mind.
1366	1352751753642	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i totally recommend this app, it saves about me of time and it's predictions are most of the time accuracy
1367	1352749602660	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour amazing keyboard the predictions are amazing and corrects all my mistakes i just wish there were more themes or a way to customize it.
1368	1352749602660	4	leneleven ratingfour i'll give it five stars if more themes are added
1369	1352746396826	5	lenseven ratingfive works awesome better than the stock keyboard.
1370	1352746396826	5	lenten ratingfive bought it at 0.25 well worth it on my samsung note 2
1371	1352746208491	1	lenthree ratingone this app sucks.
1372	1352746208491	1	lenthree ratingone plain and simple.
1373	1352746208491	1	lenseven ratingone wish i could get my money back.
1374	1352745956154	5	lentwelve ratingfive great work, learns from all your mistakes and knows its grammar too.
1375	1352737282255	5	lensix ratingfive genius, much better keyboard all round!
1376	1352736354785	4	lentwenty ratingfour i like it much better than some of the others i've tried, but it has some annoying, little problems.
1377	1352736354785	4	leneight ratingfour predictions are often great, but sometimes just stupid.
1378	1352736354785	4	lenthirteen ratingfour and certain things you type often, it won't learn, and constantly "corrects"
1379	1352736354785	4	lenthirtyone ratingfour and while it will intelligently place a period or comma right behind the word you last selected, it won't do it for closing quotation marks, leaving a gap "like this "
1380	1352736354785	4	lenfive ratingfour nitpicky stuff, yes, but annoying.
1381	1352723834817	5	leneleven ratingfive my typing skills s___k. this app is truly a blessing.
1382	1352723834817	5	lenten ratingfive i can send a message or email quickly and efficiently.
1383	1352723834817	5	lenthree ratingfive this app rocks!
1384	1352723834817	5	leneleven ratingfive it has the word i want to use before i do.
1385	1352718901897	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this is simply the best option available for a touch-keyboard on android.
1386	1352718901897	5	lenten ratingfive the predictions are smart and allow you to type quickly.
1387	1352718901897	5	lenfortyfour ratingfive when i upgraded phones to a galaxy s3, i briefly stuck with the default swype-style keyboard just to see if i liked it, and i immediately missed so many of swiftkey's features--not only the smart predictions, but the presence of symbols like "/"
1388	1352718901897	5	lenthirteen ratingfive as alternatives to keys that become accessible by holding them down and dragging.
1389	1352718901897	5	lenthirteen ratingfive design like this saves you from having to toggle through several other "symbol"
1390	1352718901897	5	lenfourteen ratingfive sets of keyboards, and when trying to access commas or exclamation points, is indispensable.
1391	1352718901897	5	leneighteen ratingfive if you miss using physical keyboards and are frustrated with touch keyboards, you need to try this one.
1392	1352718901897	5	lensix ratingfive it cuts down on frustrations immeasurably.
1393	1352714812835	1	lentwentytwo ratingone sadly got a very annoying new bug where i press the middle selection and sometimes it actually uses a totally different word!
1394	1352714812835	1	leneleven ratingone also it seems to have unlearnt all these years of learning.
1395	1352712886442	5	lennine ratingfive just typed this in portrait mode in under 7 seconds.
1396	1352711720441	5	lentwo ratingfive absolutely brilliant!
1397	1352709317080	3	lennineteen ratingthree i know you have your own reasoning but having a comma and period in the slider just increases mistakes.
1398	1352709317080	3	lennineteen ratingthree i'm not going to use the slider for those 2 punctuations when they've already got their own keys.
1399	1352709317080	3	lennine ratingthree swipe right for question mark, swipe left for exclamation.
1400	1352709317080	3	lenseven ratingthree make that change and it's 5 stars.
1401	1352708727855	5	lensixteen ratingfive just like the other reviews say, the input is smooth and the predictions are very accurate.
1402	1352708727855	5	leneight ratingfive the only app i've ever paid for!
1403	1352705603429	5	lenthree ratingfive awesome auto correct.
1404	1352705603429	5	lenfive ratingfive love the various themes available.
1405	1352705603429	5	lentwelve ratingfive it learns all the words u type and predicts it very precisely.
1406	1352702605394	2	lentwentyfive ratingtwo swiftkey 3 its crashing in web browser (chrome and stock browser) while selecting search bar and editing txt. :-( please fix.  edit; no fix as to date 12/nov2012
1407	1352702141539	5	lenseven ratingfive this has improved my typing so much.
1408	1352702141539	5	lenthree ratingfive amazing stuff guys!
1409	1352702059323	5	lenten ratingfive this app is the best keyboard app ive ever had.
1410	1352702059323	5	lensix ratingfive although you should make more themes.
1411	1352702059323	5	lentwo ratingfive like colors.
1412	1352701942278	4	lenthree ratingfour love the keyboard.
1413	1352701942278	4	lensixteen ratingfour can you build a version for the note 2 so you can utilize the handwriting to text
1414	1352701851237	5	lentwelve ratingfive the voice to text does not work most of the time though.
1415	1352700856317	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard.
1416	1352700856317	5	leneleven ratingfive lots of stuff to customize, great auto-correct and word predictions.
1417	1352700856317	5	lentwelve ratingfive texting is way faster with this keyboard than the default android one.
1418	1352700290899	5	lenten ratingfive this apps helps you a lot when you are writing.
1419	1352700290899	5	lenthirteen ratingfive since it learned your common phrases and words from the sms,  facebook,  gmail.
1420	1352700290899	5	lenseventeen ratingfive also you can customize the size of the keyboard layout when it's on portrait or landscape.
1421	1352700290899	5	lenthree ratingfive highly recommend app!
1422	1352699545666	4	lenten ratingfour the stock keyboard on my gsiii was driving me crazy.
1423	1352699545666	4	lentwelve ratingfour swiftkey has fixed almost all the issues i was having with typos.
1424	1352699545666	4	lentwentyeight ratingfour my only suggestion is to release an update that lets me choose weather or not a 'space' is automatically inserted after punctuation (automatically after a period for example)
1425	1352696930376	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny
1426	1352696501237	5	lentwelve ratingfive prediction works very well,  the smart space is very interesting and useful.
1427	1352696501237	5	lenthirteen ratingfive the only thing i could think to suggest is custom colored keyboard themes.
1428	1352696029792	4	lenfour ratingfour this app needs emoji.
1429	1352696029792	4	lenseventeen ratingfour i want to be able to talk to my friends who use it on there i phones.
1430	1352695073282	5	lenfive ratingfive i hated the samsung keyboard.
1431	1352695073282	5	leneight ratingfive you won't regret buying the full version.
1432	1352693961683	5	lenfour ratingfive very cool, love it
1433	1352689792093	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i've tried all the other keyboards and this one is definitely worth it.
1434	1352687205144	5	leneighteen ratingfive i never thought replacing my standard keyboard on the gs3 was necessary but i'm very glad i did.
1435	1352687205144	5	leneleven ratingfive this is much smoother and doesn't lock up and freeze.
1436	1352687191229	5	lenfifteen ratingfive really does an incredible job, the predictions are really accurate, which is even freaky sometimes.
1437	1352687191229	5	leneight ratingfive i am a lot faster than i was.
1438	1352687191229	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i wish there was a dictionary that i could edit to add or delete some words and more themes would be the best.
1439	1352687191229	5	lentwelve ratingfive however, it's the best keyboard on the market, without a doubt.
1440	1352685610268	5	lenseventeen ratingfive hi guys, i was wondering if you can add whatsapp app to the personalisation of the keyboard.
1441	1352685524284	5	lenten ratingfive thanks for saving me 10,000 strokes, can use them elsewhere ;-) x
1442	1352682001649	5	lentwelve ratingfive it's so fast and is really accurate and corrects so well
1443	1352681792414	5	lenten ratingfive i love how the dictionary supports two languages at once
1444	1352680412801	3	lenfourteen ratingthree it doesn't seem to access my gmail for personalization, it keeps saying failed.
1445	1352680412801	3	lenthirteen ratingthree please fix the minor bug, other than that it's an excellent app.
1446	1352677105326	5	lennine ratingfive faz o teclado do iphone sentir vergonha de existir.
1447	1352676053201	5	lensixteen ratingfive i used to despise typing in portrait since this is my first full touch screen phone.
1448	1352676053201	5	lenfourteen ratingfive the stock keyboard was horrid but when i decided to switch over to swiftkey.
1449	1352676053201	5	lenthirteen ratingfive everything literally became easier and faster to text and/or type quick documents.
1450	1352676053201	5	lensixteen ratingfive i wish it had swype tho but either way, i'm still giving it a 5 star.
1451	1352676053201	5	lenten ratingfive this keyboard is amazing and i love it a lot.
1452	1352675821419	5	lentwo ratingfive uber-recommend.
1453	1352675640306	5	lenseven ratingfive best keyboard ever, i highly recommend it
1454	1352674267576	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i had this keyboard for the past few months and i love it!
1455	1352674267576	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i heard that you guys are working on a swipe feature and ill be waiting for it!
1456	1352674267576	5	leneight ratingfive but just one thing it needs more colors :)
1457	1352671191434	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i use dual languages and english is always the first choice despite me writing much more and frequently in the other language.
1458	1352671191434	5	lennine ratingfive is there no way of changing the language priorities?
1459	1352668728799	4	lenten ratingfour why doesn't it save swear words as primary words?
1460	1352668728799	4	leneight ratingfour it doesn't even save the word "gay"
1461	1352668728799	4	lenfour ratingfour as a primary word.
1462	1352668728799	4	lenseven ratingfour which would mean this app is homophobic.
1463	1352666597213	4	lenfortyone ratingfour saves time and corrects errors, quite good at predicting next words or phrases but if you make a serious typo or have fat fingers like me, you can rush off into a sentence and end up deleting / retyping loads of words.
1464	1352666597213	4	lennineteen ratingfour also can't find a way to remove such typos so it will predict incorrectly from time to time.
1465	1352666432539	5	lenseventeen ratingfive this keyboard let's me type as fast as i want and it corrects all my typos.
1466	1352663756476	4	lenten ratingfour i can never go back to the original stocked keyboard.
1467	1352663756476	4	lenfour ratingfour it was worth purchasing
1468	1352662855323	4	lentwelve ratingfour cannot download the list of languages required to make this app work.
1469	1352662855323	4	lentwenty ratingfour this bug was reported somewhere around the first of august and no solution has yet been reported by the developer.
1470	1352662855323	4	lenfive ratingfour a waste of money, imho.
1471	1352662855323	4	leneleven ratingfour edit: this is indeed fixed and therefor i change my rating.
1472	1352658504452	1	lenthree ratingone need more themes.
1473	1352658504452	1	lentwo ratingone need t9 input
1474	1352656065001	5	lennine ratingfive saves a shed load of time with its predictions.
1475	1352655441957	5	lensix ratingfive had first tried the trial version.
1476	1352655441957	5	lentwelve ratingfive after the trial, directly purchased the full version without any second thoughts.
1477	1352655441957	5	lensix ratingfive it made me lazy in typing.
1478	1352655441957	5	leneleven ratingfive hope there will be such programs for the desktop or laptops.
1479	1352654949207	5	lensix ratingfive very good app, worth the money.
1480	1352652678583	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour so, i bought and paid for swiftkeyx, and now you release a tablet version and i'm supposed to purchase the same app again?
1481	1352650594927	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo after a number of frustrating months, they seem to have sorted the issues with sgs2.
1482	1352650594927	2	lenten ratingtwo it still has the odd hickup but generally works well.
1483	1352650389842	4	lentwo ratingfour super app.
1484	1352650389842	4	lenthirtytwo ratingfour faroese language is not registered, and i understand why because it is so small, but i wish i somehow could personalize the languages even more.so that it automatickly remebers faroese words
1485	1352648839307	1	leneleven ratingone for some reason the predictive text is not working at all.
1486	1352648060057	3	leneighteen ratingthree but now, every other time i go to use the keyboard, i'll type but nothing comes up
1487	1352647003050	5	lensixteen ratingfive i don't think the price is out of line given how well this keyboard works.
1488	1352647003050	5	leneight ratingfive the predictive text and corrections are nearly perfect.
1489	1352647003050	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive i also appreciate that they give you a month to try out the full version rather than a dummied down version with tons of ads.
1490	1352647003050	5	lenseven ratingfive i won't be without this baby.
1491	1352647003050	5	leneight ratingfive by far the best app i have installed.
1492	1352646157350	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this keyboard is great,  incredibly accurate, even for a fat finger (thumb) typist like me.
1493	1352646157350	5	lenfour ratingfive predictions are nearly flawless.
1494	1352640667683	3	lenseven ratingthree it remembers stuff you say so well.
1495	1352640667683	3	leneight ratingthree it remembers chains and predicts the next word.
1496	1352640667683	3	leneleven ratingthree there are a few bugs though and they're extremely annoying.
1497	1352640667683	3	lentwentyfour ratingthree for example, the auto-correct and prediction will randomly stop working and i have to repeatedly exit and start again for it to work.
1498	1352640667683	3	lenthirteen ratingthree sometimes the keyboard in general will stop working and it won't type.
1499	1352640667683	3	lenfourteen ratingthree i have to press random letters for about 5-10 seconds for it to work again.
1500	1352640667683	3	lennine ratingthree then when it finally does the first bug happens.
1501	1352640667683	3	lensix ratingthree it's a great keyboard though.
1502	1352639811249	5	lenfive ratingfive if it swyped too, godlike.
1503	1352639691186	5	lennine ratingfive beats the heck of any other keyboard out there
1504	1352636470769	5	lensix ratingfive keyboard, the best i have seen.
1505	1352635585641	5	lenten ratingfive this app is the best app i've ever tried.
1506	1352635585641	5	lensix ratingfive it will transform your mobile experience.
1507	1352635585641	5	lenseven ratingfive the programming behind this must be stupendous.
1508	1352635585641	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive the developers really go all the way into perfecting this jewel: the app learns about the way you type, the mistakes make, so it gets better the more you use it.
1509	1352635585641	5	lenten ratingfive you can also customise keyboard size, and long-press time.
1510	1352635585641	5	leneleven ratingfive this single app makes android phones more worthwhile than an iphone.
1511	1352634647232	5	leneight ratingfive i would totally recommend this app its brilliant!
1512	1352633944774	3	lenthirteen ratingthree i would give this app 5 star if only it has simplified chinese support
1513	1352633727266	4	lennine ratingfour this is the best keyboard i've ever used.
1514	1352633727266	4	lennine ratingfour two issues i have are: no chinese language support.
1515	1352633727266	4	lenfifteen ratingfour i'm a student in a chinese speaking country and this would be very handy.
1516	1352633727266	4	lennine ratingfour 2, sometimes when i type very quickly, the word disappears.
1517	1352633727266	4	leneight ratingfour hope this can be addressed in future updates.
1518	1352633727266	4	lenseven ratingfour apart from those, a very brilliant app.
1519	1352630988481	1	lenthirtynine ratingone after working superbly for months the app unexpectedly caused constant force closes and lock ups on my samsung galaxy s2 (freezing app with titanium backup solved the problem as i couldn't uninstall the app with all the fc's).
1520	1352630988481	1	lentwelve ratingone i informed customer services via email and received no reply or confirmation.
1521	1352630988481	1	lensixteen ratingone widely reported issues with the app not just isolated to the version on amazon app store.
1522	1352627679169	3	lenthirteen ratingthree have turned off as does not support pen entered text on samsung note 2.
1523	1352627679169	3	leneight ratingthree the samsung predictive text is catching up though.
1524	1352626399727	4	lenfifteen ratingfour making it learn from whatsup messenger would make things way better no one texts anymore
1525	1352625269701	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive love i have a htc one x i wish it had a vibrate option for every time you hit a key other then that great!
1526	1352624731791	4	lenthirtynine ratingfour i would like it if it had an option where i could arrange some keys such as the number toggle to the other side and be able to choose our own type of layout, (htc, stock android, touchwiz, etc.).
1527	1352623596801	3	lenthirteen ratingthree i'm sure this works as advertised, but i love swype too much.
1528	1352622908256	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this app has made me laugh with surprise at the accuracy of its predictions.
1529	1352622908256	5	lentwelve ratingfive i can sometimes complete full sentences just by tapping the words suggested.
1530	1352622908256	5	lenfive ratingfive useful extra features as well.
1531	1352622560360	5	leneight ratingfive beautifully done  keyboard and so easy to use.
1532	1352615420403	5	leneight ratingfive this is the best keyboard app hands down!
1533	1352613774813	1	lensix ratingone slider doesn't work on galaxy s3
1534	1352611821546	5	lentwo ratingfive super great
1535	1352609015038	5	leneight ratingfive perfect input method if there's also chinese!
1536	1352609015038	5	lenfive ratingfive the correction is just awesome!
1537	1352609015038	5	lenfourteen ratingfive also it works fine on both my htc one x and google nexus 7, bravo!
1538	1352602968862	5	lenten ratingfive this is probably the best touch board i have used.
1539	1352602968862	5	lenfifteen ratingfive however i noticed that with my asus tablet it occasionally stops working particularly with facebook .
1540	1352602968862	5	lenten ratingfive i often have to restart the tablet to fix this.
1541	1352602632303	5	lensix ratingfive sickest keyboard you will ever use.
1542	1352600965140	1	leneleven ratingone not sure why but it auto inserts "i"  after every period.
1543	1352600780306	5	lenten ratingfive unbelievable predictions, it sometimes guesses exactly what you're thinking!
1544	1352600780306	5	lennine ratingfive 100x better than the stock samsung keyboard, a must buy!
1545	1352600557379	5	lensix ratingfive me like fat girls and swiftkey 3
1546	1352600085418	4	lentwenty ratingfour 1-would be great of the hight of the space bar can be adjusted to avoid hitting the lowest line letters.
1547	1352600085418	4	lenthirtyfive ratingfour 2- add a feature to remove mis-spelled words 3- ability to utilize names in the address book to predict, or use the gmail address book for prediction-seems to be doing that but not very effective!
1548	1352599330243	5	lenthree ratingfive great writing app.
1549	1352599330243	5	leneleven ratingfive sometimes it will mod words to things i don't intend.
1550	1352599330243	5	lenfive ratingfive but still an amazing app!
1551	1352599330243	5	lenthree ratingfive great time saver!
1552	1352596871220	5	lensix ratingfive the best keyboard for my android
1553	1352593535926	4	lentwelve ratingfour i got the trial and once it learned everything i loved it.
1554	1352593535926	4	lensixteen ratingfour just bought the real thing after the period expired and now it has to relearn everything.
1555	1352587673852	5	lenfive ratingfive so intuitive and user-friendly.
1556	1352581876098	5	lenfifteen ratingfive great app, have been using it since swiftkey x and is well worth the money.
1557	1352581876098	5	lentwentynine ratingfive only problem is every time i turn my phone off, i have to select the keyboard as an option in my phone settings and turn the keyboard back on.
1558	1352581876098	5	lenten ratingfive this just started happening recently though, still an amazing app.
1559	1352579483444	5	lenfive ratingfive simply the best keyboard around.
1560	1352579483444	5	lentwenty ratingfive got a galaxy s3 and hated the keyboard, trialed this one (thanks for a free full trail) and never looked back.
1561	1352578977749	3	lenfourteen ratingthree when sharing a web page to facebook auto correct and spell check are broken.
1562	1352578977749	3	lenthree ratingthree jellybean on gnex.
1563	1352576682286	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree had previously given this 2 stars, but they've made a lot of improvements over the past couple years, so i gave it 3.
1564	1352576682286	3	lenfourteen ratingthree still not nearly as fast and responsive as the stock android ics/jb keyboard.
1565	1352574169027	5	lenfive ratingfive way better than go keyboard.
1566	1352574169027	5	lenseven ratingfive uses a little less resources is too.
1567	1352572739466	1	lenthree ratingone 10mo internal memory use?
1568	1352572739466	1	lensix ratingone remember where this app is for?
1569	1352569736280	5	lentwentythree ratingfive after giving a bad rating because downloading languages was not possible i got an answer within few hours that the server was down.
1570	1352569736280	5	lenfive ratingfive thank for your speedy support.
1571	1352569736280	5	lentwelve ratingfive typing this rating with swiftkey without any flaws,  very fast and accurate.
1572	1352568257294	5	lenseven ratingfive can't download language packs in jellybean.
1573	1352568257294	5	lenseven ratingfive always get network error no matter what.
1574	1352568257294	5	lenfive ratingfive edit: thanks for the reply.
1575	1352567495951	5	lenthree ratingfive the perfect keyboard.
1576	1352567495951	5	lenten ratingfive it's easy, customizable, incredibly intuitive and simple yet beautiful.
1577	1352567495951	5	lenthree ratingfive my favorite app.
1578	1352567495951	5	lentwenty ratingfive it's the first app i install and the first app i recommend to any new (and old) android user.
1579	1352567495951	5	lenthirteen ratingfive btw, i've used it on a htc hero, evo, evo 3d, & evo 4g lte.
1580	1352565692519	1	lenfourteen ratingone i'm wondering if an update killed the predictions, because they used to work.
1581	1352565195276	4	lensix ratingfour edit: it appears to be fixed.
1582	1352563286365	1	lenfourteen ratingone runbish, installed but wouldnt download languages so couldnt use it pluss couldnt re fund
1583	1352562459193	1	lentwentyfive ratingone i decided to buy full version but now i can't even complete the installation process.this is total trash and i am out of 4bucks!
1584	1352562157316	2	lenthirtytwo ratingtwo has been my keyboard of choice for a while but it just doesn't work on jelly bean - if you can't download the language packs you can't use the keyboard!
1585	1352562157316	2	lenthirty ratingtwo hoping this gets fixed soon - 3 weeks without even a response from swiftkey suggests they may be more interested in their flow version than making sure the current one works though.
1586	1352559820276	4	lentwentysix ratingfour updated comment: new update has made it difficult to type a question mark at speed (surely one of the most common keys! v frustrating- please revert)
1587	1352559423131	1	lenfour ratingone this is extremely frustrating.
1588	1352559423131	1	lenfourteen ratingone i very much effort this application, but it has been rendered useless to me.
1589	1352559423131	1	lenfour ratingone please repair your product!
1590	1352558390661	1	lenseven ratingone cannot download the languages or use it
1591	1352556942351	1	lentwentyone ratingone i just heard all these good things about this app and then right from the start the languages don't download.
1592	1352555806593	2	lenfive ratingtwo before it started hiding key.
1593	1352555806593	2	lentwentytwo ratingtwo when you long press a key to get the options it hides behind the other keys but only on 3rd party text boxes.
1594	1352552439218	5	lentwelve ratingfive i'm using it under cyanogenmod 10 and it works like a charm!
1595	1352552439218	5	leneight ratingfive i'm a big fan of this tool.
1596	1352552225193	4	lentwo ratingfour awesome app.!
1597	1352552225193	4	lenten ratingfour gets  5 stars when, a password manager / sync ability is added.
1598	1352552225193	4	lenten ratingfour or at least make it easier to switch between keyboards.
1599	1352552225193	4	lenthirtytwo ratingfour i find myself constantly switching between lastpass & swiftkey keyboards. :-\   other than that, its great app.although it kinda sucks how i had to pay for multiple downloads for each of my devices.
1600	1352552225193	4	lenthree ratingfour however, im happy.
1601	1352552225193	4	lenseven ratingfour a lot easier to use than sywipe.
1602	1352550766681	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i love this keyboard and have been using it since i bought my galaxy s2.
1603	1352550766681	5	lentwentyone ratingfive only complaint is a space is automatically inserted after every word, and i can't work out how to disable this
1604	1352550720900	5	lenfour ratingfive seriously, and great app.
1605	1352550720900	5	leneight ratingfive one of the best predictive text apps ever.
1606	1352549121422	1	lenfive ratingone wont get past setup screen
1607	1352548346558	3	lennine ratingthree this app needs to stop adding spaces after punctuation.
1608	1352548346558	3	lentwentyfour ratingthree if i add punctuation i hit space and now i get double spaces after commas etc! needs an option to stop it at least!
1609	1352543341422	5	lensix ratingfive but there should be more themes
1610	1352542283155	4	lenten ratingfour amazing product, would be nice if it has swipe feature
1611	1352532659826	3	lensixteen ratingthree plz make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz
1612	1352532505891	4	lenseven ratingfour keeps freezing and writing nonsense on google.
1613	1352532505891	4	lenfour ratingfour plus really delayed writing.
1614	1352532505891	4	lennine ratingfour i wish there was an option for ios typing!
1615	1352531774597	3	leneleven ratingthree the keyboard itself is great but the word predictions are atrocious.
1616	1352531774597	3	lentwentyfive ratingthree why can't it learn directly from all of my typing, instead of having to via gmail, twitter or facebook - none of which i have.
1617	1352531774597	3	lenfour ratingthree please improve the predictions.
1618	1352526828698	5	leneleven ratingfive i  love this app, have been using it for 3 months now.
1619	1352526828698	5	lenfour ratingfive the predictions are amazing.
1620	1352526828698	5	lensixteen ratingfive i think the app learns your writing patterns and tries to mimic them in the predictions.
1621	1352526828698	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive this app makes typing so easy that i was almost paralyzed when i had to use a regular keyboard on my sister's phone yesterday.
1622	1352526828698	5	lennine ratingfive i am not longer used to finishing my words.
1623	1352526828698	5	lentwentythree ratingfive also, when i have had a problem, all that i have to do is go to their facebook page and they respond quickly!
1624	1352525604830	5	lenten ratingfive this is truly the greatest thing i have ever seen.
1625	1352525604830	5	lentwentyone ratingfive it allows me to type on a touch screen without looking at it, that's how accurate itnis at predicting texts.
1626	1352525604830	5	lenfour ratingfive amazing worth every penny
1627	1352524503189	5	lenthirteen ratingfive best keyboard that u can find, thr personalization on it is just unpredictable!
1628	1352524375850	4	lenseventeen ratingfour it would be great if i can change the color of the words suggestions section in themes.
1629	1352524375850	4	lensixteen ratingfour i like the light theme but wish for words suggestions to be in jellybeans blue color
1630	1352521988889	4	leneighteen ratingfour it's alright i guess but it seems to have a knack for freezing up high end devices
1631	1352520313145	4	lenten ratingfour overall, this is the best kb app i've found.
1632	1352520313145	4	lentwelve ratingfour it claims to learn your typing style & i call bs on that.
1633	1352520313145	4	leneighteen ratingfour words i commonly use are constantly changed to completely different words & it can slow me down a lot.
1634	1352520313145	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour i have the typing style set to precise & i'd hate to see how bad it would be in the predictive setting.
1635	1352520313145	4	lenfifteen ratingfour this review alone, i've had to fix quite a few of swiftkey's errors.
1636	1352520313145	4	lensix ratingfour it's fixed none of mine.
1637	1352520313145	4	lentwelve ratingfour i'd really like it if the precise setting actually meant it.
1638	1352518131579	5	lenfiftysix ratingfive at first i wasn't quite sure the best way to use it, but after playing with it a bit, i found that even if you just utterly mash the keys and hash out words very quickly and sloppily, since it does such a great job at predicting your words it will still work very accurately.
1639	1352518131579	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive then if you have longer words in your sentence it's a lot quicker to hit one button to complete the last 6 letters of a word than to type it all out.
1640	1352518131579	5	lentwenty ratingfive at first glance it seems like it's just another autocomplete, but it's so much more functional than that.
1641	1352516285563	5	lenfive ratingfive makes messaging so much easier
1642	1352514382887	5	lenten ratingfive i couldn't type well until i downloaded the app.
1643	1352513820446	5	lenten ratingfive makes entering text a joy rather than a fiddly chore.
1644	1352512014753	5	lentwo ratingfive add emoji
1645	1352511536163	2	lenfive ratingtwo predict row gone after standby.
1646	1352511536163	2	leneight ratingtwo backspace on auto correct doesn't undo correction.
1647	1352511536163	2	leneight ratingtwo long press predict doesn't have similar words.
1648	1352511341865	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive reading the couple of reviews that wanted this program to understand text message shortcut language and then spell it out, i had to respond.
1649	1352511341865	5	lenfive ratingfive this is an awesome program.
1650	1352511341865	5	lenfourteen ratingfive it fixes my typos (which on a smartphone are often and many) almost always.
1651	1352511341865	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i would be a tenth as fast as what i am, without this program.
1652	1352506390311	5	lennine ratingfive this is exactly what i've been looking for!
1653	1352503992046	3	leneleven ratingthree love the keyboard but i frequently get "cannot load language packs"
1654	1352503992046	3	lenfive ratingthree big pain in the rear.
1655	1352503208195	5	lentwentyone ratingfive worth every penny, swapped my iphone 5 for a note 2 and was disappointed with the texting this app solves all the issues.
1656	1352501015439	3	lensix ratingthree best keyboard app on the market.
1657	1352501015439	3	lenten ratingthree but the lack of customization is really this app back.
1658	1352501015439	3	lenthirteen ratingthree everyone is obviously asking for it,  so let's make some progress please.
1659	1352497070707	5	lenten ratingfive i love this keyboard but rhe original layout is tacky.
1660	1352497070707	5	lensix ratingfive the pumpkin one looks amazing though.
1661	1352497070707	5	lenfifteen ratingfive if there was a green or red version of pumpkin i would be even happier.
1662	1352497070707	5	lenthree ratingfive overall awesome though.
1663	1352492335277	3	lensix ratingthree não ?mentira, esse app realmente faz maravilhas.
1664	1352492335277	3	lenfour ratingthree quando voce fala ingles.
1665	1352492335277	3	lenten ratingthree no portugues ele corrige contraçoes (-inho, -ão, .) as convertendo para palavras normais.
1666	1352492335277	3	lennine ratingthree esse ?um dos inumeros problemas com a lingua portuguesa.
1667	1352492335277	3	lennine ratingthree recomendo s?se for usar para digitar em ingles.
1668	1352492335277	3	lentwentynine ratingthree e o app trava sempre com o chrome e tem problemas na rotaçao da tela, quando o celular ?girado, o app deixa a tela toda preta pro alguns segundos (galaxy s2)
1669	1352487594380	4	lenfifteen ratingfour i would like to see a button to minimize the keyboard like the go keyboard.
1670	1352487594380	4	lenten ratingfour also the alternate symbols i would like to turn off
1671	1352485840737	3	lenseven ratingthree need update to get rid of bugs.
1672	1352485840737	3	lenfourteen ratingthree bug1 - when swiping (ie to delete a word) , the last key touched is then entered.
1673	1352485840737	3	leneight ratingthree bug2 - auto-input of words seems a bit off.
1674	1352485840737	3	leneleven ratingthree ie it is inputting words when i'm not requesting it.
1675	1352485840737	3	lenfive ratingthree hard to explain the second?
1676	1352485355270	2	lenfour ratingtwo been so sluggish lately.
1677	1352483721369	5	lenfive ratingfive i want new f****** designs.
1678	1352480402451	5	lenseventeen ratingfive so many options.it learns the way you type.looks great.what more could you ask for?
1679	1352480402451	5	leneleven ratingfive and the dedicated number pad is what every keyboard should have.
1680	1352479546185	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo . i sometimes have to wait up to a minute for the keyboard to appear.
1681	1352479546185	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo shouldn't have to restart my phone to be able to type an sms.
1682	1352479546185	2	leneleven ratingtwo also it seems to forget everything it's learnt on occasion.
1683	1352479546185	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo why did i pay for this when it seems to also be free and identical?
1684	1352479505643	4	lenfortysix ratingfour it's the best keyboard i have used by far, and i love the themes (but maybe a couple more? or a way to make our own?) but it has issues with certain words like page, which it often automatically capitalizes or it will change "love"
1685	1352479505643	4	lensixteen ratingfour it appears to be a minor glitch and not an actual function of the keyboard itself.
1686	1352479505643	4	lenthirteen ratingfour in lieu of these aforementioned issues being adjusted, i will gladly grant 5 stars.
1687	1352479505643	4	lenseven ratingfour ^o^ overall, an excellent job, you guys!
1688	1352479505643	4	lentwo ratingfour ~samsung galaxy s3
1689	1352476910420	4	lenfive ratingfour can't download english us.
1690	1352476910420	4	lenfour ratingfour forgets all my presets.
1691	1352476910420	4	lentwelve ratingfour still the best but has tapered back to the field a little.
1692	1352476902290	1	lennine ratingone i can't believe i paid for this keyboard.
1693	1352476902290	1	lenten ratingone it is truly the worst keyboard ever on a galaxy s3.
1694	1352476902290	1	lennine ratingone i hate it and i want my money back.
1695	1352476902290	1	lenten ratingone uninstalling and would give it zero stars if i could.
1696	1352474140572	5	leneighteen ratingfive amazingly useful, had i known about this app earlier, would have switched from ios a long time ago.
1697	1352469253153	5	lenseven ratingfive i wish i would've downloaded sooner.
1698	1352466184339	5	lenten ratingfive definitely helpful when i need to respond to something quickly.
1699	1352466184339	5	lenfourteen ratingfive it learns and may become smart enough to kill you.like in "i, robot".
1700	1352451052976	5	lennineteen ratingfive it makes it super easy to text in english then português without having to switch to a completely different keyboard.
1701	1352420831253	1	lenseven ratingone found and reported a bug via email.
1702	1352420831253	1	lenten ratingone developer won't respond unless i register for their forum.
1703	1352420831253	1	lenfive ratingone this isn't customer service.
1704	1352419721220	5	lentwenty ratingfive i bought this even though my phone came with swype, because the word predictions are way faster than on swype.
1705	1352419721220	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive the swype might seem faster than normal, but text predictions on this app are always better, so i can actually text faster because of it, 2nd to none.
1706	1352417362757	5	lenfive ratingfive 100% cannot live without you swiftkey!
1707	1352417278655	3	lensix ratingthree hate hate hate the numeric keyboard.
1708	1352416517494	5	lenthirteen ratingfive could do with a jellybean update to fix a few integration glitches occasionally
1709	1352416116824	4	lenseventeen ratingfour with the new jelly bean update is there gonna be any support for emojis within this keyboard
1710	1352415894355	5	lenfifteen ratingfive but keeps failing to download english language pack update so now i have no autocorrect :(
1711	1352415848476	4	lentwentythree ratingfour i just wish they would come out with a lot more themes or give option to install custom made themes by other people
1712	1352412277001	4	lenthirtyfour ratingfour i would give it a 5 star as it's perfect but it's annoying that despite being set as my default keyboard i still have to switch to it every time my phone restarts.
1713	1352412265593	4	lentwelve ratingfour isn't flawless, but it's assuredly the best on the market.
1714	1352410170372	2	lentwentyfour ratingtwo i like the speed it allows me to type but the predictions that automatically insert when i don't notice change my word completely.
1715	1352410170372	2	lentwentyseven ratingtwo and the most annoying thing of all that hasn't been fixed yet by any update, is the app some how turns off my haptic feed back.
1716	1352409665739	5	lensix ratingfive much better than original android keyboard!
1717	1352409665739	5	lensix ratingfive love the customisation options and themes!
1718	1352409077367	3	lensixteen ratingthree great but need an option for 4.0 and above to suppress language key in the status bar.
1719	1352409077367	3	lennineteen ratingthree i deleted the stock keyboard because this is so good but i still get that because of voice typing.
1720	1352409077367	3	leneleven ratingthree add that in and some more themes and it will be 5stars.
1721	1352409077367	3	lenfifteen ratingthree a white theme like you have but with a dark grey background would be awesome
1722	1352408521942	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive have had the app for  > 6 months now, and as it continues to learn my usage, i'm getting down to typing as little as 25% of my final text.
1723	1352408521942	5	lensix ratingfive thanks guys, for writing this app !
1724	1352407938641	5	lentwelve ratingfive what a great app so easy for for peeps with fat fingers.
1725	1352407938641	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i only took me two hours to type this instead of the normal four!
1726	1352402611535	5	lennine ratingfive can you please support emoji and more skins plz.
1727	1352401736086	5	lensix ratingfive the original s3 keyboard is an embarrassment.
1728	1352401736086	5	lenseven ratingfive swiftkey is intuitive and makes typing enjoyable.
1729	1352401736086	5	lensix ratingfive i wish it had trace however.
1730	1352401318688	5	lentwentysix ratingfive started using this the other day and i am amazed at how much better this keyboard is compared to the one that comes with the phone.
1731	1352401318688	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive much more accurate typing and the space bar is a lot bigger so i am not accidentally pressing unneeded buttons when i go to push the space.
1732	1352401222684	5	leneleven ratingfive this speeds up my typing so much, i just love it!
1733	1352399990088	5	lentwelve ratingfive the android keyboard is nice, however the swiftkey keyboard is even better!
1734	1352399990088	5	lenthirteen ratingfive with it's features, i have gotten used to swiftkey in a day.
1735	1352399768544	5	lentwentyone ratingfive bought it on s3 after using the trial for the full month, after which i had to upgrade which i obviously did.
1736	1352399768544	5	lentwenty ratingfive the only downside to the trial is that i had to do 2 mins of settings upon installing the full version.
1737	1352399768544	5	lensix ratingfive runs smoothly and without any trouble!
1738	1352399437462	5	lensix ratingfive big improvement over standard android keyboard.
1739	1352399437462	5	lenfifteen ratingfive but i do need to switch off some features that, for me, go too far.
1740	1352398831671	5	lenseven ratingfive awesome at my sloppy big finger typing.
1741	1352398129565	5	lenfive ratingfive fantastic, quite a mind reader!
1742	1352396776793	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo with a recent update to jellybean, swiftkey no longer automatically uses predictions when texting.
1743	1352396776793	2	lentwentytwo ratingtwo i have to back out of every message and go back in before it will start fixing typos or using predictive text.
1744	1352396776793	2	lensix ratingtwo this is very frustrating and annoying.
1745	1352396776793	2	lenthree ratingtwo galaxy s3 with sprint.
1746	1352396514898	5	leneighteen ratingfive i type fast and often miss the space bar and string words together, this makes it a breeze
1747	1352396058945	1	lenseven ratingone waste of money wot a rip off
1748	1352395424600	5	lenseven ratingfive i run my business from my phone.
1749	1352395424600	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i don't buy a lot of apps because i can usually find a free app that would do the job just fine.
1750	1352395424600	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i would buy this keyboard if it was 3 times the price it is absolutely awesome.
1751	1352395424600	5	lentwelve ratingfive the way it anticipates what you want to type is almost scary.
1752	1352395424600	5	leneight ratingfive try for 2 weeks and see what you think.
1753	1352390959533	5	leneight ratingfive i tried the free vs and was hooked!
1754	1352390959533	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive improved speed, freakishly accurate predictions, great layouts, attractive designs, makes typing on my phone more than just easy -i'm much more productive, too.
1755	1352388901959	2	lentwentyone ratingtwo there is a horrible lag with jellybean, it shows up in google now or right after a txt message is sent.
1756	1352388145299	5	lenseven ratingfive i saw this on an app review.
1757	1352388145299	5	lenfour ratingfive i downloaded the trial.
1758	1352388145299	5	lenten ratingfive loved the trail so then i downloaded the full version.
1759	1352388145299	5	lenseven ratingfive worth every cent. wonderful tool to have.
1760	1352388145299	5	lennine ratingfive i my typing accuracy is more better than before.
1761	1352388145299	5	lenthirtyfour ratingfive some improvements should be made by increasing the amount of fonts etc and more personalising but apart from that this baby works like a charm and i wouldn't have it any other way!
1762	1352386692418	5	lenten ratingfive i never thought i'd be paying for a keyboard.
1763	1352386692418	5	leneleven ratingfive but i bought after only a week of the 30 day trial.
1764	1352386692418	5	lenfive ratingfive best setup and word suggestions.
1765	1352385414588	5	lennine ratingfive this is great, absolutely love it and recommend it.
1766	1352385414588	5	lennine ratingfive very clever software that fixes most of my typos.
1767	1352385414588	5	lenfourteen ratingfive just needs next/prev buttons on web form filling like the samsung keyboard has.
1768	1352385414588	5	leneleven ratingfive way better than that default board with much more intelligent layouts.
1769	1352385414588	5	leneighteen ratingfive ?sign in the first page of num/symbol screen as well as the array of long press options.
1770	1352384754899	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard app in the market!
1771	1352383787387	3	lentwentyeight ratingthree i love this keyboard, i purchased i and it works perfectly in all save two situations:  use with google drive in typing long documents, it lags like crazy.
1772	1352383787387	3	lenfourteen ratingthree use with google chrome it glitches out, becoming invisible and generally failing to operate.
1773	1352380339862	5	lenthirtyfour ratingfive freaks me out how it can predict my words kind of crazy but cool i hardly ever type the hole words any more just a few letters and it does the rest for me.
1774	1352379879824	4	lenfifteen ratingfour from a functionality standpoint it's great, but from a cosmetic standpoint it's lacking.
1775	1352379879824	4	lenthree ratingfour need more themes.
1776	1352324248114	4	lenten ratingfour i need the new update to swype in swift key!
1777	1352321433530	5	lensix ratingfive this keyboard is perfect for me.
1778	1352321433530	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i wanted a bigger spacebar,  customizable layout and quick access to punctuation and emoticons.
1779	1352321433530	5	leneight ratingfive the auto corrections are smart and configurable too.
1780	1352321433530	5	lenfive ratingfive i highly recommend this keyboard.
1781	1352321433530	5	lentwo ratingfive htc rezound.
1782	1352321370824	4	lenfour ratingfour overall an interesting app.
1783	1352321370824	4	lenfortyone ratingfour would give it five stars if some things would be attended to, like the ability to completely disable it on physical keboard, adding swype-like functionality or more complex control over automatic spacing or such removal of it in certain conditions.
1784	1352321370824	4	lenfive ratingfour otherwise promising, bought to support.
1785	1352320629769	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive typing in 'obama' will bring in highlighted suggested options 'is' which will also bring up the and then 'best' si it basically makes out "obama is the best"
1786	1352320002453	5	lenthree ratingfive money well spent.
1787	1352319430094	1	lentwelve ratingone there's a bug where the predictive keyboard doesn't always register.
1788	1352319430094	1	lennine ratingone very frustrating and defeats the point of the keyboard.
1789	1352319430094	1	lenthree ratingone otherwise pretty good!
1790	1352316128171	3	lennineteen ratingthree to be fair, i've only been using swiftkey for a few days, but it's not for me.
1791	1352316128171	3	lenten ratingthree maybe i just used the standard keyboard for too long.
1792	1352316128171	3	lensixteen ratingthree it's a good app that does exactly what it says, but it has its downfalls.
1793	1352316128171	3	lenthirtyfour ratingthree the word prediction is spot on, the different themes look great, but the inability to use swype is annoying, as is the inability to use alt+backspace to delete an entire line of text.
1794	1352316128171	3	lenfourteen ratingthree but like i said, i've only been using it for a few days.
1795	1352316128171	3	lensixteen ratingthree i'll keep using it for a few more and see if it grows on me.
1796	1352314922658	5	leneleven ratingfive have been struggling with the default keyboard on my new galaxy 3.
1797	1352314922658	5	lenfifteen ratingfive two weeks into the unhappy affair and i have finally got round to downloading swiftkey.
1798	1352314922658	5	leneight ratingfive i didn't realise how much missed you!
1799	1352314922658	5	leneight ratingfive i won't ever leave you again xxxxx
1800	1352311604281	5	lensix ratingfive the best keyboard i've used.
1801	1352311604281	5	lenfourteen ratingfive got this during a sale for 50% off and its the best value-for-money.
1802	1352311604281	5	lensixteen ratingfive its freakishly accurate in predicting my next words and symbols and numbers work like a charm.
1803	1352311510428	4	lenfifteen ratingfour i'd pay more for a beer so why not pay for a smart keyboard?
1804	1352311510428	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i i got the trial and less than a day later i bought it.
1805	1352311510428	4	lensix ratingfour brilliant for typing in different languages!
1806	1352311510428	4	lenfifteen ratingfour the ?character in spanish isn't really needed these days though, hence my 4 star rating.
1807	1352309821112	5	lensixteen ratingfive the shortcuts to the punctuations; the word predictions; the clean layout and look of the keys.
1808	1352309821112	5	lensix ratingfive it's absolutely worth the purchase!
1809	1352307805069	3	lentwelve ratingthree great app but they screwed croatian keyboard to the point of unusability
1810	1352304398827	5	lenfive ratingfive awesome keyboard, end of story.
1811	1352304398827	5	lenten ratingfive better than swype, slideit and any others i've tried
1812	1352300069894	4	lenseventeen ratingfour swype works terrible on this phone, so this is a welcomed answer to the problem of typing.
1813	1352298163280	5	lensixteen ratingfive the way it predicts my next word and corrects the current ones are just plain awesome.
1814	1352298163280	5	lentwenty ratingfive i can just literally smash my finger around and swiftkey will figure out what word i was trying to type!
1815	1352241559829	2	lenseventeen ratingtwo if you can't fix this (that ? is under c, ?is under z, etc) please refund me.
1816	1352241212369	5	lenfiftyone ratingfive i tried this keyboard juat on a whim, i used to use the swipe input,but this way is a lot faster most of the time it knows what i am trying to say so it saves me from having to delete and try again,i would definitely reccomend this keyboard.
1817	1352239229230	5	lensix ratingfive wish i would have never updated.
1818	1352239229230	5	lenfourteen ratingfive misses all kinds of letters now and not nearly as responsive as it was.
1819	1352239229230	5	lentwelve ratingfive and hate that the question mark and period are the same key.
1820	1352238975518	4	lenseven ratingfour until i had to reboot my phone.
1821	1352238975518	4	leneight ratingfour this was the first app that i redownloaded
1822	1352237143248	5	lenfourteen ratingfive after one weeks use:  39% more efficient 10.143 keystrokes saved 1.941 typos corrected 94 words predicted 1.037 words completed
1823	1352233958328	5	lennine ratingfive bought the tablet version then bought the phone version.
1824	1352233311240	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i am quite careless when i text sometimes i can write a whole word with only 1 or 2 letters right and it fixes it.
1825	1352233311240	5	lenfifteen ratingfive the prediction is ridiculously awesome and has a great memory on what you text often.
1826	1352233311240	5	lennine ratingfive it also has cool colors you can choose from.
1827	1352232337379	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i've tried many keyboard but this one is the best of all.
1828	1352232337379	5	lenseven ratingfive saved me hundreds of thousands of keystrokes.
1829	1352230468483	5	lentwenty ratingfive much better than stock samsung, but like others are saying, a personal dictionary would be great and the word shortcuts.
1830	1352230468483	5	lensixteen ratingfive it would also be great if you would release new features e.g. swiftkey 'flow' quicker.
1831	1352230369196	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard out there, hands down.
1832	1352230369196	5	lenfive ratingfive please add support for vlingo.
1833	1352229158026	5	lenfive ratingfive this keyboard is really great.
1834	1352229158026	5	lentwentythree ratingfive with it's adaptive speech, text predictions, voice input, etc., it truly is the best (and to think i used to use swype).
1835	1352229158026	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i have had 3 android phones and a tablet and i have this installed on all of them.
1836	1352229158026	5	lenten ratingfive i even have it installed on friends' devices as well.
1837	1352229158026	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive the only thing i can say that could certainly be better is possibly the auto correction and most definitely the grammar suggestions.
1838	1352229158026	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i like to be grammatically correct so it's an issue for me.
1839	1352228920188	2	lentwentyeight ratingtwo because if a user inputs a valid word, the program should not auto-replace it with anything else, no matter how much more relevant it thinks that is.
1840	1352228194320	5	lenseventeen ratingfive every time my singular words get autocorrected to plural i wish i could get my money back.
1841	1352227810325	5	lenfive ratingfive this is a great keyboard.
1842	1352227810325	5	leneleven ratingfive only thing lacking is the ability for handwriting with note 2 spen.
1843	1352227810325	5	lentwo ratingfive great app!
1844	1352227615375	5	lenfour ratingfive value for the money
1845	1352225769490	5	lenfive ratingfive this app is simply amazing!
1846	1352225769490	5	lenseven ratingfive a must have for every android user.
1847	1352225623500	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i've tried go, swipe, fat, and i come back to swiftkey keyboard every time.
1848	1352225623500	5	lenthirtythree ratingfive i have been using the paid version for about 2 years and they have improved to the point where the talk to text feature is unmatched by anyone, no errors, it knows me well.
1849	1352225623500	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i also love how it translates as you speak, and allows me to pause and think about what i will say next.
1850	1352225623500	5	lenten ratingfive just go straight to the paid version, money well spent
1851	1352224586211	4	lennine ratingfour it even predicts when i'll call my mom!
1852	1352219814120	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard app on the market
1853	1352219557913	5	lenfourteen ratingfive it stores your strokes and you will have less chance to correct your spelling.
1854	1352219557913	5	lentwo ratingfive nice job
1855	1352216226421	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive android 4.2 keyboard is so nice looking,  please add a theme that look like that or add a theme with separate keys and no gradient shade on keys.
1856	1352212345399	5	leneight ratingfive i do wish they would add different fonts.
1857	1352211714265	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this app is magnificent, it makes the default keyboard look like a piece of junk.
1858	1352211373288	5	leneleven ratingfive i hate this thing right noww i loved the old version.
1859	1352211373288	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive this one doesn't put in the prediction if you press the spacebar and doesnt backspace the whole word if you just swipe it back and i dont like this layout change it back please!
1860	1352209628861	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i have used many a different keyboard in my life but this one is surely the best!
1861	1352209530502	5	lenfifteen ratingfive give it a week to learn your writing style and it's predictions are perfect
1862	1352208780167	4	lenseventeen ratingfour how come it doesn't save the words that i have been entering for a lot times?
1863	1352207347697	4	lenseventeen ratingfour one thing i wish is that if we purchased this one, we get the tablet one free.
1864	1352207347697	4	lentwelve ratingfour other than that, i would never go back to a normal keyboard!
1865	1352206715057	5	lenten ratingfive the only thing wrong with the galaxy s3 was the keyboard.
1866	1352206715057	5	lenthree ratingfive predictions are awesome.
1867	1352206715057	5	lenfive ratingfive thanks for the great keyboard!
1868	1352154867731	4	lentwo ratingfour great app.
1869	1352154867731	4	lenten ratingfour only complaint is lack of color options for the themes.
1870	1352154867731	4	lensix ratingfour otherwise amazing predictions and running smoothly.
1871	1352153049351	5	lentwenty ratingfive i love the app, but i am still having the prompt come up asking me to select my default keyboard.
1872	1352153049351	5	leneleven ratingfive every time i type it wants me to select default keyboard.
1873	1352153049351	5	leneleven ratingfive i'm mentioning it here because developer doesn't know either.
1874	1352153049351	5	lenfive ratingfive i have the samsung galaxy.
1875	1352153049351	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i try to turn off my android keyboard but there is no option for it.
1876	1352153049351	5	lenseven ratingfive i know it's a android issue.
1877	1352153049351	5	lensix ratingfive thought maybe someone here could help
1878	1352152702256	3	lenthirteen ratingthree i like everything about this app with 1 (very significant) exception.no swipe feature.
1879	1352152702256	3	lentwentythree ratingthree i am super-dependent on using swipe to enter words, so without that, there's no real point in me having this app.
1880	1352152702256	3	lentwelve ratingthree once that feature is in place, i'll be back on board 100%.
1881	1352152650435	5	leneleven ratingfive this is truly the best app i have on my phone.
1882	1352152650435	5	lensixteen ratingfive it is worth the few bucks, trust me - get it and you will not be disapointed .
1883	1352152120670	5	lentwentyone ratingfive swiftkey is easily the best keyboard out of the three that i've used (stock keyboard and swype being the others).
1884	1352152120670	5	lentwentyone ratingfive not only is it more accurate with keystrokes and predictions,  but it also has a better layout and is more customizable.
1885	1352152120670	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i've been using it for about three months now and i'll never use anything else.
1886	1352150335859	5	leneight ratingfive well swift key is a great productive investment.
1887	1352150335859	5	lenseven ratingfive you will hardly type 30% of the text.
1888	1352150335859	5	lenfive ratingfive rest predicted by swift key
1889	1352150128564	5	lenfive ratingfive works flawless on my motorola xt890.
1890	1352150128564	5	lentwelve ratingfive i finally discovered joy of sms, email, whatsapp, etc. i love it.
1891	1352147235699	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour i'd like it more context sensitive (eg: email vs sms, my gf vs my boss,  etc), but not sure if android passes that info.
1892	1352147235699	4	lenfifteen ratingfour it forces close when using on chrome, quite randomly, but too often to be acceptable.
1893	1352147235699	4	lenfifteen ratingfour this is why i rate 4 stars, it's been like that for too long now.
1894	1352146940184	5	lentwelve ratingfive you haven't started using an s3 till you've used this app!
1895	1352146940184	5	lenfive ratingfive it makes typing a dream.
1896	1352146417074	5	lenfour ratingfive it reads my mind.
1897	1352145291136	5	leneleven ratingfive this app is the best thing on the market for sure!
1898	1352145291136	5	lentwelve ratingfive it makes me want to type out whole paragraphs all the time.
1899	1352145291136	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i'm going to have to get the unlimited texting plan now or something.
1900	1352144572087	5	lenfour ratingfive works great, looks great.
1901	1352144572087	5	lenseventeen ratingfive my only wish would be: that the typing field could be skinned to match the keyboard theme.
1902	1352144572087	5	lennine ratingfive also a christmas theme would be awesome this year ;-)
1903	1352143686691	4	lenthree ratingfour long time user.
1904	1352143686691	4	lensix ratingfour it's finally working on chrome!
1905	1352143686691	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour i don't understand why the predictions were so mediocre on my rezound, but i'm thrilled with them on my verizon galaxy s3, usually.
1906	1352143686691	4	lenten ratingfour still wish for an option for the old small spacebar.
1907	1352143686691	4	lennine ratingfour i don't like to inaccurately slide for punctuation.
1908	1352143667918	2	lenthree ratingtwo very nice app!
1909	1352143667918	2	leneleven ratingtwo but why does nice app need more energy than the display.
1910	1352141958610	4	lensixteen ratingfour but has an annoying habit of auto correcting correctly spelt shorter words into inappropriate longer ones.
1911	1352141958610	4	lentwo ratingfour otherwise great!
1912	1352141161526	5	lenfive ratingfive you cant beat thus keyboard.
1913	1352141161526	5	lenfive ratingfive saves a lor of time.
1914	1352140349155	4	lenfourteen ratingfour this is the best keyboard ever, but it eats quite a lot of memory
1915	1352140069391	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i am new to android and this keyboard makes my 'radpid' lifestyle so much easier.
1916	1352140069391	5	lenthree ratingfive thank you swiftkey!
1917	1352135470168	5	lenthree ratingfive best keyboard replacement.
1918	1352135443638	5	lenseven ratingfive best keyboard app in the android market!
1919	1352134862178	5	lennine ratingfive i found one of the best apps for mobile.
1920	1352134862178	5	lenseven ratingfive do you have similar program for desktop?
1921	1352134862178	5	lensix ratingfive my typing speed increased like anything.
1922	1352130720214	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo this is a good keyboard but has a tendency to lag when texting.
1923	1352130720214	2	lensixteen ratingtwo sometimes i even have to restart my phone just to get it to work more smoothly.
1924	1352130720214	2	lenseven ratingtwo was 3 stars now 2 till problem is fixed
1925	1352130606412	5	lensix ratingfive absolutely worth every cent of it.
1926	1352130428605	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive it's annoying when it tries to guess the next word i want after commas and periods, but its sooooooon much better than my standard keyboard system.
1927	1352130195937	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo pretty good,  comes up with some funny predictions though,  can be very annoying at times.
1928	1352129070352	4	lenfifteen ratingfour this app tight it just we just need more control over the keyboard more customizing
1929	1352128716748	3	lenthirteen ratingthree as i'm typing the cursor jumps to the middle of a sentence.
1930	1352128531852	3	lensixteen ratingthree it has some great features, but there is a noticeable lag with my gsm galaxy nexus.
1931	1352128531852	3	leneight ratingthree had to remove and use the stock keyboard.
1932	1352128003392	4	lenfour ratingfour needs chinese language support
1933	1352127848209	5	lentwo ratingfive absolutely handy.
1934	1352126022152	5	lenfour ratingfive truly a superb app.
1935	1352126022152	5	lensix ratingfive it must've saved me hours.
1936	1352126022152	5	lenthree ratingfive really great vfm.
1937	1352124010492	5	lensix ratingfive but still best keyboard hands down!
1938	1352124010492	5	lentwo ratingfive cursor arrows!
1939	1352122809449	4	lensix ratingfour good application for my samsung note 2.
1940	1352122809449	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour sometimes the auto correct feature doesn't appear and i have to exit the text message and re open it for it to appear.
1941	1352122809449	4	leneleven ratingfour i purchased the application but please address bug in next release.
1942	1352982897435	5	lenseventeen ratingfive saves me so much trouble - often knows what i want to put even before i do! :p
1943	1352981560778	4	lentwentysix ratingfour i cannot judge anything.as i am not able to install the language files.when contacted support, reply is that they don't support custom roms.
1944	1352981560778	4	lentwentyeight ratingfour please have an update which will support custom roms.or please alter the compatibility for app ,so that only people whose device will support the app will purchase .
1945	1352978514130	5	lensix ratingfive very much my keyboard of choice.
1946	1352978514130	5	lenfifteen ratingfive just wish you would make the option to add internet address suffix a user option
1947	1352976012786	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo it won't autocorrect my misspellings when set to inert a period with double space.
1948	1352976012786	2	leneighteen ratingtwo when set to insert a prediction, will insert a random word whenever i use punctuation and then space.
1949	1352976012786	2	lenseventeen ratingtwo takes twice as long to type a message due to all the errors i must manually correct.
1950	1352976012786	2	lentwentysix ratingtwo on the other hand it is fun to just hit spacebar over and over to see what bizarre message it comes up with on its own.
1951	1352974306802	5	lentwentythree ratingfive this is a god send i have a small android phone and fat fingers, this keyboard makes life so much easier for me :)
1952	1352970828085	1	lenten ratingone its  garbage it's no different than the original typing.
1953	1352970828085	1	lenthirtyfive ratingone the whole point of the samsung galaxy is the swiping, it differs from every other kind of phone, and this app does not support swiping this app sucks,i wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
1954	1352970126991	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i've used most keyboards for android, i had the trial of this for a whole hour before i purchased the full version.
1955	1352969132953	5	lennineteen ratingfive simply the best keyboard for android phones, though i can't get mine to stop vibrating when i type.
1956	1352964995379	5	leneleven ratingfive when transferring from the trial, it didn't keep my data.
1957	1352964995379	5	lenten ratingfive i really enjoyed looking at my stats and my dictionary.
1958	1352964995379	5	lenfive ratingfive maybe i did something wrong?
1959	1353070466554	1	lentwentysix ratingone i hate the fact that you can't turn off predictions, and i also hate that you can't turn off the automatic space after punctuation.
1960	1353070466554	1	lensix ratingone otherwise, this is a great keyboard.
1961	1353065957373	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive i used to always use the stock android keyboard but have just found that the jelly bean one just isn't as good as this.
1962	1353065957373	5	lenseventeen ratingfive it's ability to correct what you type when you miss keys or mistype words is incredible.
1963	1353065957373	5	lentwentyone ratingfive my typing has become a lot quicker and i love the fact that there are so many options to customise this.
1964	1353065957373	5	lentwentyone ratingfive the prediction abilities are pretty amazing as well, it gives you a great insight into words that you use so often!
1965	1353065957373	5	leneighteen ratingfive this is definitely the best 3rd party keyboard and in my opinion, the best keyboard to use on android.
1966	1353054263507	5	lenseven ratingfive but pleeeeeease make more color skins available:-)
1967	1353053779000	5	lensixteen ratingfive i came from the iphone which made the samsung keyboard the worst part of my day.
1968	1353053779000	5	lenfour ratingfive this app changed everything.
1969	1353053779000	5	lensixteen ratingfive it's intuitive, corrects accurately 99% of the time and leaves every other keyboard in the dust.
1970	1353053779000	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny.
1971	1353048466851	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard.
1972	1353048466851	5	lenthirteen ratingfive would be cool if we could have some emojis added on to it
1973	1353047009883	5	lenfour ratingfive i just love swiftkey.
1974	1353047009883	5	lenfour ratingfive ich liebe swiftkey einfach.
1975	1353046795331	3	lentwentyfive ratingthree for some reason when i paid for this app all the predictions went whack and it is much harder to write messages now not impressed.
1976	1353046766176	2	lentwo ratingtwo wayyyy better.
1977	1353040740634	1	lensixteen ratingone had this app for a while now,  all of a sudden unable to load language packs.
1978	1353039475730	5	lensixteen ratingfive saves me so much time when replying to emails and texts about my self defence classes.
1979	1353039475730	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive where i would have to repeat myself, or have to save a draft with all the info for a new student/client, i can now reply in seconds, but make the message/email more personal.
1980	1353039475730	5	lentwenty ratingfive trust me, it will save you so much time and effort that you will wonder how you managed without it!
1981	1353038167444	5	lenfourteen ratingfive first i was skeptical if it could be better than the normal samsung keyboard.
1982	1353038167444	5	lenseventeen ratingfive and i must say its fenomenal much easier to write and so much for faster, love it.
1983	1353038167444	5	lentwenty ratingfive it's magical how it detect what i intend to write, and also supports several languages at the same time.
1984	1353036873680	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo did extensive testing and swift key was the cause of my widgets not refreshing.
1985	1353036873680	2	leneight ratingtwo great app if it wasn't for that.
1986	1353036505310	2	leneight ratingtwo this keyboard needs to come into the 21st century.
1987	1353036505310	2	lensix ratingtwo it's missing swype and emojis.
1988	1353036505310	2	lenfive ratingtwo i regret buying this app.
1989	1353033198040	1	lentwelve ratingone the prediction is near perfect but i like typing the whole word.
1990	1353033198040	1	lenfour ratingone call me old fashioned.
1991	1353033198040	1	lenthree ratingone love the layout.
1992	1353033198040	1	lenthirteen ratingone 5 stars when i can disable prediction in favor of more screen real estate.
1993	1353033198040	1	lenthree ratingone everything else perfect.
1994	1353030627767	5	lenthirtynine ratingfive nor do i buy apps, but with the frustration from the poor keyboard that came stock on my razr,  i was so happy with swiftkey i didn't wait for the trial to end,  i just bought the app.
1995	1353030627767	5	lenten ratingfive i am thinking of getting it for my tablet too.
1996	1353027453348	5	lentwelve ratingfive one of the only apps i've never had a problem with
1997	1353022933466	4	lentwelve ratingfour the language pack finally downloaded so all is well for the moment.
1998	1353018355340	2	leneight ratingtwo the keyboard ant even keep with y fingers.
1999	1353018355340	2	lenseventeen ratingtwo ipps rds and t result looks like h. cant* up with my* it skips*and* the* gibberish*
2000	1353017596828	5	leneleven ratingfive works ok.  don't like the look of it on ics.
2001	1353017596828	5	lensix ratingfive plz make a nice ics theme.
2002	1353016670434	1	lenfifteen ratingone every time i restart my note 2 (at&t jellybean 4.1.1) it reverts back to samsung keyboard.
2003	1353016670434	1	leneleven ratingone i have to re select swift keys again to use it.
2004	1353015813323	5	lenthirteen ratingfive please we need new and updated features in this our beloved keyboard app.
2005	1353015813323	5	leneighteen ratingfive likewise, a mini app version compatible with multi-windows feature in samsung galaxy note 1 and 2 is urgently needed.
2006	1353013686657	1	lensixteen ratingone was working fine until it said that it is unable to load language packs, including english!
2007	1353010988756	5	lenseven ratingfive the best keyboard i've ever had!
2008	1353010988756	5	lentwenty ratingfive just finished up the trial version yesterday and found how difficult it was to go back to my old keyboard.
2009	1353006702975	5	leneleven ratingfive i never comment on anything but had to about swift key.
2010	1353006702975	5	lenten ratingfive this is by far the best app i have downloaded.
2011	1353006702975	5	lentwelve ratingfive it is super smart and makes typing and texting such a breeze
2012	1353006276853	5	lenfour ratingfive need support for note 2
2013	1353005181879	4	lentwelve ratingfour i like the swiftkey overall and use it as my daily driver.
2014	1353005181879	4	leneleven ratingfour but it's got warts (on both my razr and prime):  1.
2015	1353005181879	4	lenseven ratingfour landscape is always full screen (no option)  2.
2016	1353005181879	4	lenthirteen ratingfour no option to toggle auto-space after punctuation and selecting predicted/corrected word.
2017	1353005181879	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour prediction doesn't show up in a lot of cases where it should - should always pop up unless in a username or password dialog.
2018	1353005181879	4	lenfifteen ratingfour speech to text doesn't come up reliably - many times pops up and immediately disappears.
2019	1353005181879	4	lenfive ratingfour sometimes sluggish to open / type.
2020	1353156752036	1	lenthirtyfour ratingone swiftkey could be 5 stars but suggests northumberland and gloucestershire instead of words people use and wants to follow julia with roberts and paul with mccartney so completely useless until that weirdness is sorted out.
2021	1353155918299	3	lennine ratingthree why there is no chinese language in this keyboard.
2022	1353155918299	3	lenseven ratingthree and also pls have more theme color
2023	1353145040243	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive my friend borrowed my phone to text our friend, and he said he could type faster on my phone than on his own iphone, despite using android for the first time.
2024	1353145040243	5	lensix ratingfive please work on chinese input soon!
2025	1353145040243	5	lensix ratingfive i hate switching to google pinyin.
2026	1353144948307	4	lenthirtyfour ratingfour this app is dam near perfect but i dont like that it doesn't have a swipe feature i dont like having to switch back and forth to use swipe which i use alot.
2027	1353144948307	4	lenseven ratingfour plz add and ill change to 5 stars
2028	1353143840498	4	lentwo ratingfour awesome keyboard!
2029	1353143840498	4	lenten ratingfour i wonder if there working on a jellybean theme keyboard?
2030	1353138997113	5	leneighteen ratingfive plain and simple i would have gone back to my iphone if it wasn't for this app.
2031	1353138997113	5	leneighteen ratingfive everything you do on your phone is surrounded by the keyboard and the stock keyboard was absolutely terrible.
2032	1353138997113	5	lenthree ratingfive shame on samsung.
2033	1353138997113	5	lensix ratingfive but the keyboard should have swype.
2034	1353133828567	5	lennineteen ratingfive i've tried a lot of keyboards for android and this is the best out of all of them!
2035	1353133828567	5	lennineteen ratingfive for a fast typer i rely on the predictions and this is the best type of keyboard i need.
2036	1353133828567	5	leneleven ratingfive predictions are awesome its like the app is reading my mind!
2037	1353133828567	5	lenfourteen ratingfive if you are going to spend money on any keyboard app this is it!
2038	1353130570632	5	leneight ratingfive very good  very fast best keyboard out there
2039	1353129020447	5	leneight ratingfive jb 4.2 removed but i need swiftkey to type.
2040	1353127923054	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i bought this app to support, i hope they add turkish layout in future.
2041	1353127923054	4	lensix ratingfour i'll raise it to 5 stars.
2042	1353127017597	3	lenthirtyfour ratingthree all my settings are set to use my swiftkey as default,  but i have to open the swiftkey app every time i turn my device on in order to be able to use it.
2043	1353126955888	4	lentwelve ratingfour would give 5 stars but it keeps defaulting back to the stock keyboard.
2044	1353125673395	5	lennine ratingfive if you have the galaxy s3 you need this app.
2045	1353125349873	5	leneight ratingfive but i wonder; what's about speech input.
2046	1353125349873	5	lenten ratingfive couldn't swiftkey come in after google's speech recognition?
2047	1353125349873	5	lenthirteen ratingfive if google is slightly wrong, swiftkey would know better out of the context.
2048	1353125349873	5	lenthirteen ratingfive a combination would be a big improvement especially for other languages than english
2049	1353125086879	1	lentwelve ratingone obnoxious keyboard, no way to turn off predictive tabs at the top.
2050	1353125086879	1	lensix ratingone predictions and corrections are always incorrect
2051	1353124944971	5	lenten ratingfive highly customizable, great auto-correct, fast (never misses a stroke).
2052	1353124625504	5	leneleven ratingfive does not work with jelly bean update: 17/11/12 - problem resolved by update.
2053	1353123982947	5	lenfive ratingfive the latest version is awesome.
2054	1353123982947	5	lenthirteen ratingfive works very well on my samsung galaxy note riding on the 4g lte network.
2055	1353123982947	5	lenseven ratingfive swiftkey also works on my android tablet.
2056	1353119322175	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this keyboard!
2057	1353119322175	5	lenfifteen ratingfive definitely worth the money and i never buy apps just wish it was more customizable.
2058	1353119322175	5	lenseven ratingfive i would love a christmas theme :-p
2059	1353113548068	5	lentwelve ratingfive i had a copy of swiftkey x i could not live without.
2060	1353113548068	5	lenfifteen ratingfive 4.1 rolled out to my gs3 and swiftkey x was acting up so i upgraded to this.
2061	1353112058353	3	lennineteen ratingthree great keyboard but i have a difficult time submitting text i have entered using this keyboard on most websites.
2062	1353112058353	3	lennine ratingthree also i find its slower to respond than skype.
2063	1353112058353	3	lenseven ratingthree maybe this will improve in future versions.
2064	1353106503354	5	lenten ratingfive wish it had the ability to use swype as well.
2065	1353106503354	5	lennine ratingfive best part is that it helps with my romanian.
2066	1353106503354	5	lenfour ratingfive definitely my favorite keyboard
2067	1353106283239	1	lensix ratingone the keyboard isn't that great.
2068	1353106283239	1	leneleven ratingone it's so annoying going back to change something multiple times.
2069	1353106283239	1	lennine ratingone i typed dad and it switched it to fad.
2070	1353106283239	1	lentwo ratingone keyboard sucks!
2071	1353102870251	5	lenfifteen ratingfive used go keyboard before, this one feels better with better prediction and some nice features
2072	1353101012676	5	lentwelve ratingfive this is the only app i have ever bought for my phone!
2073	1353101012676	5	lenten ratingfive it's such a time saver and i love it!
2074	1353100975311	5	lenfive ratingfive cant function with out it.!
2075	1353099778529	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i tried the trial and was very impressed.tried to go back to the standard samsung keyboard and there is no comparison
2076	1353098484726	5	lenfour ratingfive great app very accurate
2077	1353233477794	5	lentwenty ratingfive download the trial, as i did, and i guarantee you will happily pay for the full version when it expires.
2078	1353233477794	5	lentwo ratingfive excellent app!
2079	1353220909863	5	leneleven ratingfive this has to be in the top 3 of my favorite keyboards.
2080	1353219692436	5	lensixteen ratingfive i've been using gesture and predictive keyboards on android for a couple of years now.
2081	1353219692436	5	leneight ratingfive when i upgraded to android 4.2, i uninstalled swype.
2082	1353219692436	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive but the android keyboard even with gestures disappoints me compared to swiftkey, which is better at prediction and as solid and reliable.
2083	1353219692436	5	lensix ratingfive i cannot wait for swiftkey flow!
2084	1353217903583	5	lentwelve ratingfive more themes please, would be great a way to create customized themes
2085	1353216862027	5	lenten ratingfive this keyboard is amazing cuts down typing time into fractions
2086	1353216827224	4	leneight ratingfour some minor issues, but by far the keyboard.
2087	1353214658134	3	lentwentyone ratingthree pls update for note 2 one hand operation also putting numbers up top like default keyboard then this is the ultimate app
2088	1353210751480	4	lenthirtytwo ratingfour i used the trial and really liked it-would actually like to see more theme choices-how about black background with red or pink-red background with black or blue-even white?
2089	1353207884362	5	lenthree ratingfive my typing app.
2090	1353203268251	1	lenfourteen ratingone every time i restart my device i need to make swiftkey as a default!
2091	1353202627000	1	lennine ratingone have tried for days to download english language pack.
2092	1353202627000	1	lensix ratingone each time i get download failed.
2093	1353202627000	1	lenseven ratingone un installed and reinstalled to no avail
2094	1353202185763	4	lenfifteen ratingfour the keyboard is great makes me type so much faster wish there was swipe though.
2095	1353198575050	5	lensix ratingfive zero lag, great features and themes
2096	1353197672687	1	leneight ratingone someone needs to add a forward delete button.
2097	1353197553181	5	lensixteen ratingfive talk to text,  wow,  never write a text message again,  neon keyboard looks great,  but it
2098	1353194794530	4	lensixteen ratingfour better than the vast majority of standard keyboards and probably the best keyboard in the market.
2099	1353194794530	4	lenfourteen ratingfour however, it would be better to have a larger, much larger, selection of themes!
2100	1353194794530	4	lentwo ratingfour leggy tosroe.
2101	1353193426676	5	lenseven ratingfive awsome typing, even in spanish or english
2102	1353193348326	5	lensixteen ratingfive way better than the stock keyboard,  and i think it's the best on the market.
2103	1353192608123	5	lenfour ratingfive please add more skins!
2104	1353187719105	5	lensixteen ratingfive like all the other buyers who bought this app said: i don't usually buy apps.
2105	1353187719105	5	lentwenty ratingfive but when a friend of mine recommended it to me and i downloaded it, i have been amazed by it.
2106	1353187719105	5	lenfive ratingfive it is accurate beyond belief.
2107	1353187719105	5	lentwenty ratingfive you would think that a keyboard app couldn't be that great, but that is where most people go wrong.
2108	1353187719105	5	lentwelve ratingfive swiftkey is not your ordinary app, it is of the next generation.
2109	1353187719105	5	leneleven ratingfive tldr: get it, it'll be worth your time and money.
2110	1353187070297	5	lennine ratingfive this is the best keyboard bin have ever used.
2111	1353187070297	5	lenfour ratingfive definitely worth the price.
2112	1353185773002	2	lentwenty ratingtwo i install it but key taking me off the swift key goes back to regular keyboard what sup with that
2113	1353183905931	5	lenseven ratingfive love that it's amazing at predictions.
2114	1353178848967	1	lenseven ratingone annoying and no better than normal keyboard.
2115	1353178848967	1	lenseventeen ratingone won't let you type in certain words easily and will often incorrectly guess and change words.
2116	1353178848967	1	lenten ratingone even writing this it annoyed me a number of times.
2117	1353178848967	1	lenseven ratingone i will be removing from my phone
2118	1353178812899	5	lenthree ratingfive just plain awesome!  :)
2119	1353329672562	5	lensix ratingfive best typing app on the market.
2120	1353327370798	4	lenfourteen ratingfour good predictions and very helpful when my fingers don't hit the right keys.
2121	1353326637273	5	lenten ratingfive it's the only app i have ever paid for.
2122	1353326637273	5	lenfour ratingfive saves so much time.
2123	1353326637273	5	lenfourteen ratingfive it's going to reduce the number of carpel tunnel cases in this world.
2124	1353324315774	4	lensix ratingfour best keyboard in the android market!
2125	1353324315774	4	lenfour ratingfour predications are quite accurate.
2126	1353324315774	4	lenthirteen ratingfour would be 5 stars if there is chinese language input and one-operations keyboard.
2127	1353324315774	4	lenseven ratingfour a personal dictionary would be ideal too!
2128	1353320990149	3	lenfourteen ratingthree first i was disappointed by google, because chrome and google now were so laggy.
2129	1353320990149	3	lenten ratingthree but then i found out that swiftkey is the problem.
2130	1353320990149	3	lennine ratingthree there is much less lag with the stock keyboard.
2131	1353320368433	2	leneight ratingtwo there is no chinese language available until today?
2132	1353320368433	2	lenthree ratingtwo pls update soon!
2133	1353320368433	2	leneleven ratingtwo ***pls don't buy if you want to type in chinese.***  2.
2134	1353320368433	2	lentwentyone ratingtwo would appreciate if user can configure single space bar to select prediction & double space bar to always insert a full stop.
2135	1353320368433	2	leneight ratingtwo (both to work at the same time time)   3.
2136	1353320368433	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo can't scroll down when keying in pop up message, like filling up review now.
2137	1353320368433	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo so i can't press "ok" and have to revert to htc sense keyboard.
2138	1353319771589	4	lenseventeen ratingfour really great and helps improving the writing speed but there is one things i don't like.
2139	1353319771589	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour if you try type for example 10 or 15 or something like that it always wants to correct it t the first number only.
2140	1353317556668	3	lensix ratingthree this is a decent keyboard app.
2141	1353317556668	3	lenten ratingthree the predicted words database can be pretty impressive at times.
2142	1353317556668	3	lenthirtyfive ratingthree i would absolutely love it if you guys could make an update that would allow the user to be able to type in a swype style format instead of having to punch letter after letter.
2143	1353317556668	3	lensix ratingthree this would seriously speed up typing.
2144	1353317556668	3	lensixteen ratingthree if you could provide this update, i will be more than happy to reevaluate my rating.
2145	1353313414547	2	lentwelve ratingtwo not that accurate if you enjoy tapping the buttons instead of gliding.
2146	1353313414547	2	leneight ratingtwo not as great as everyone makes it seem
2147	1353313050731	4	lentwentyseven ratingfour lately there has been issues where the auto correct won't work and sometimes i'll type but nothing pops up, not until i try like 100 times
2148	1353312270293	3	lenten ratingthree keeps crashing when trying to tag posts on tumblr app.
2149	1353312270293	3	lensix ratingthree emoji support would be awesome to.
2150	1353311476933	5	lennine ratingfive works way better than my phones built in swype.
2151	1353311476933	5	lennine ratingfive i think the predictive text stuff is just fantastic.
2152	1353311476933	5	lenseven ratingfive more themes please is all i ask!
2153	1353309863899	1	lenthree ratingone swipe functions broken
2154	1353305844626	1	leneight ratingone keeps force closing before i even finish enabling.
2155	1353305775713	4	lenthirteen ratingfour this app fixes the only thing iphones have over android - a good keyboard.
2156	1353305775713	4	lentwentysix ratingfour to bring this rating up to 5 stars please change these 2 things:  1) swiftkey should learn from sms, gmail etc automatically without having to go through settings manually.
2157	1353305775713	4	lenfourteen ratingfour before i knew this it annoyed me swiftkey wasn't learning from my sms.
2158	1353305775713	4	lenthirtyfour ratingfour 2) when you type a word that's not in the dictionary and swiftkey changes it to something i don't want, when i backspace i should have my originally typed word as an option.
2159	1353300652610	5	lenfour ratingfive need you say more?
2160	1353300652610	5	lentwo ratingfive okay fine.
2161	1353300652610	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it learns how you talk to better predict you and save you time.
2162	1353300652610	5	lenseven ratingfive the heat map is amusing also lol!
2163	1353300243864	1	lenfive ratingone auto correct is horribly inaccurate.
2164	1353296354678	5	leneleven ratingfive best keyboard out there with the some of the ugliest themes
2165	1353292615942	1	lennine ratingone the auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous.
2166	1353292615942	1	lenseven ratingone allow the option to turn it off.
2167	1353292615942	1	lenfifteen ratingone if you haven't tried a.i.type keyboard, then you're seriously missing out.
2168	1353291351412	5	lenten ratingfive i never really got into typing on smart phones before.
2169	1353291351412	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive i use it for german and english and it's easy to switch language, i easily get all the ?, ¨¹'s etc whilst keeping the prediction language i mainly need for that text.
2170	1353291351412	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i was actually looking for a keyboard that kept the extra line for the numbers.
2171	1353291351412	5	lentwentyone ratingfive but holding 'till you get the extra click works really well and the text prediction saves me so much more time.
2172	1353291351412	5	leneight ratingfive i bought it after less than an hour!
2173	1353291351412	5	lentwo ratingfive great job!
2174	1353290690506	1	lenseventeen ratingone no no no! i was looking for an iphone like keyboard but this does not cut it.
2175	1353290690506	1	lenten ratingone sorry guys, it's slow and autocorrect is sub par.
2176	1353290690506	1	leneleven ratingone download the stock ics keyboard and get the real android experience.
2177	1353290073247	5	lenthree ratingfive love this keyboard!
2178	1353289264612	5	lenfive ratingfive this is a awesome app.
2179	1353289264612	5	lensix ratingfive way better than they stock keyboard.
2180	1353289264612	5	lenfive ratingfive are there some hidden keys?
2181	1353289264612	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i only ask because somehow i manage to insert a fish when i press on a blank word prediction square above the predicted words.
2182	1353288824202	4	leneight ratingfour would give 5 stars if have more skin colors.
2183	1353288507955	5	lentwenty ratingfive awesome app, i can type so much for faster than before, but it makes typing alot more comfortable and convenient.
2184	1353288507955	5	leneight ratingfive i just wish i could download more themes
2185	1353286082255	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i was totally shocked by how much less typing i had to do.
2186	1353286082255	5	lentwelve ratingfive it recognizes commonly typed sentences and allows you to choose the word.
2187	1353286082255	5	lenfive ratingfive this app is a keeper.
2188	1353284929326	5	lentwelve ratingfive this is by far the best keyboard application on the android market!
2189	1353284929326	5	lenfour ratingfive love the neon :d
2190	1353406155565	2	leneleven ratingtwo then a couple updates hit and screwed up the word prediction.
2191	1353406155565	2	lensixteen ratingtwo has quite a few bugs with jelly bean like it always asking to select input method.
2192	1353406155565	2	lenseventeen ratingtwo in all it got quite frustrating to use and personalization didn't seem to help a bit.
2193	1353406155565	2	leneleven ratingtwo i had to uninstall and go back to the stock keyboard.
2194	1353401772688	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i absolutely fell in love with this keyboard after i tried out the demo version.
2195	1353401772688	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i vowed to buy it once i got my gs3 and have not looked back since.
2196	1353401772688	5	lennine ratingfive i love it and would recommend it to anyone.
2197	1353401218743	4	lensix ratingfour on gingerbread it was lighting fast.
2198	1353401218743	4	leneleven ratingfour on ics its slow and gets caught a lot while typing.
2199	1353399590814	5	lensix ratingfive amazing will never use another app
2200	1353399525826	5	lennine ratingfive the samsung stock keyboard is appalling, this is not.
2201	1353399525826	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive quite simply put, if you try this app and get used to it you'll find it very difficult to go back.
2202	1353399525826	5	lennineteen ratingfive i don't normally purchase apps, but for the sake of a pint, i made an exception for this.
2203	1353398882738	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive love this keyboard - coming from a phone with a hardware keyboard (nokia n900), i was a bit nervous about moving to phones with soft-keyboards.
2204	1353398882738	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive after downloading swiftkey, i'm more than happy and love the learning type-ahead and it's ability to work out what i was trying to type when my big thumbs get in the way!
2205	1353397888752	4	lentwo ratingfour great app.
2206	1353397888752	4	leneight ratingfour the predictions work absolutely fine for other languages.
2207	1353397888752	4	lensix ratingfour will give 5 when swype is implemented.
2208	1353396647579	4	lenthirtyfive ratingfour i love this keyboard but u guys have to get better key sounds :( i don't like the one u have now! get new key sounds like the iphone one and this will get 5 starts :)
2209	1353392154695	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this keyboard!
2210	1353392154695	5	lenten ratingfive i actually can type without looking at the phone sometime.
2211	1353392154695	5	lenten ratingfive it would be perfect if there was a backspace key!
2212	1353391456532	5	lenthree ratingfive awesome once configured
2213	1353386929500	5	lenten ratingfive finally a use for facebook and hundreds of sms messages!
2214	1353385702700	4	lennineteen ratingfour there had been highs and lows for this keyboard but it's the best and only one for me.
2215	1353385702700	4	leneighteen ratingfour better at learning words in my native language but would be better if it actually had my language.
2216	1353385702700	4	lenseven ratingfour filipino/tagalog pack and emoji plugin then 5*.
2217	1353385628849	4	lenten ratingfour would give 5stars if there's an option for chinese language
2218	1353385497664	1	lenthirteen ratingone found out that this is overrated and auto correction can be a pia.
2219	1353385497664	1	lenten ratingone worse thing is that this keyboard drains your battery life.
2220	1353385497664	1	lentwenty ratingone i did some research on the web and sure enough, other people are reporting the same issue with battery life.
2221	1353385497664	1	lenfive ratingone please fix battery drain problem.
2222	1353385497664	1	lenten ratingone i disabled swift key and my battery life has improved.
2223	1353385497664	1	lenfifteen ratingone if you're thinking about getting this wait until the battery issue has been resolved.
2224	1353384424800	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this keyboard.
2225	1353384424800	5	lentwentyone ratingfive in the configuration screen i set it as my default keyboard but after a while it keeps shifting to another keyboard.
2226	1353384424800	5	leneight ratingfive i have to do it everyday, really annoying.
2227	1353384424800	5	lenfifteen ratingfive it might be an android issue, but still there should be a solution for it.
2228	1353384424800	5	leneleven ratingfive wish we had a support forum about the product we download.
2229	1353382472294	3	lenthirteen ratingthree if you could slide your finger to text then it would be amazing.
2230	1353382472294	3	lenfour ratingthree i'm using touchpal!
2231	1353382284023	5	lensix ratingfive incredibly intelligent and fast keyboard software.
2232	1353382284023	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive this keyboard makes it very easy to actually type things correctly on your phone instead of having the spelling and grammar of a second grader that is characteristic of many messages typed on cell phones.
2233	1353381607307	5	lennineteen ratingfive great keyboard,  not a fan of the smile face button though,  an option too remove that would be great
2234	1353381505713	5	lentwo ratingfive sooooo slow.
2235	1353381463070	5	lenfive ratingfive i cannot fault this app.
2236	1353381463070	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i didn't believe the hype but it makes typing so much better.
2237	1353381463070	5	lenseven ratingfive seriously worth every cent spent well done
2238	1353381049890	5	lenseven ratingfive much more responsive than my stock keyboard
2239	1353380913026	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this app is by far the most incredible app i have ever used.
2240	1353380913026	5	lenthree ratingfive predictions are perfect.
2241	1353380913026	5	lenthirteen ratingfive what really won me over was the amount of customization you can use.
2242	1353380913026	5	lennine ratingfive perfect for any user because you choose your experience.
2243	1353380913026	5	lenseven ratingfive very nicely done developer, continue your work!
2244	1353380244484	5	lenfive ratingfive so much better than stock
2245	1353379083187	1	leneleven ratingone seriously, swear words are not allowed to be added to dictionary.
2246	1353379083187	1	lensixteen ratingone otherwise good but don't upgrade to a tablet or they will make you pay again.
2247	1353379083187	1	lenfive ratingone going to go stock 4.2 keyboard.
2248	1353379083187	1	lentwelve ratingone oh and the software hangs you wait and wait then it works.
2249	1353379083187	1	lentwelve ratingone it's a keyboard there is no reason why it should hang.
2250	1353379083187	1	lentwelve ratingone i shouldn't have to wait for my input device to load.
2251	1353377902685	1	lenfourteen ratingone ak za nieco platim, chcem aby to bolo podla mojich predstav a bez chyb.
2252	1353377902685	1	lentwentyseven ratingone klavesnica castokrat zadava  velke pismena a, v v strede vety a 9 mb zabera v internej pamati a dalsich 20 mb v ramke, co je pre mna dost vela.
2253	1353377902685	1	lensixteen ratingone ak sa tieto 3 nedostatky odstrania, tak mate odomna 5 hviezd, kedze je to mudra a rychla klavesnica.
2254	1353376321895	5	lennine ratingfive i type in spanish and english all the time.
2255	1353376321895	5	lenfourteen ratingfive with this keyboard i don't have to switch languages back and forth.ever!
2256	1353376321895	5	lenthree ratingfive excellent keyboard app!
2257	1353376321895	5	lensixteen ratingfive when my trial ended and went back to regular one, i immediately bought the full version.
2258	1353376321895	5	leneleven ratingfive this has been my very first paid app i've gotten.
2259	1353376321895	5	lenfour ratingfive definitely worth the 4 bucks.
2260	1353502510652	1	leneight ratingone horrible lag. <---- that message took 5 minutes to type.
2261	1353501468735	1	lenthree ratingone version 2 was perfect.
2262	1353501468735	1	lenfour ratingone version 3 is just bad !
2263	1353501468735	1	lenfourteen ratingone whenever i wanna use the sign () it always write wrong and impossible to use.
2264	1353501468735	1	leneleven ratingone many people try to contact and complain but nobody answer there !
2265	1353501468735	1	lenten ratingone i have tried to ask if possible to add "numbers"
2266	1353501468735	1	lennineteen ratingone on top of the keyboard like on samsung original keyboard and they sent me to write on their blog.
2267	1353501468735	1	lensix ratingone but no one answer, nobody care.
2268	1353501468735	1	leneleven ratingone when they became good, they just ignore the customers at all.
2269	1353501468735	1	lenseven ratingone i wish i wouldn't pay them !
2270	1353501468735	1	lenfifteen ratingone after a yer of disappointment and ignorant i am going back to the stock keyboard .
2271	1353501468735	1	lennineteen ratingone p.s. it help to correct mistakes but in the stock keyboard i dont get any mistakes at all.
2272	1353500310713	3	lentwentysix ratingthree half of the time it's great, but also the other half of the time i feel like throwing my very expensive phone at a wall.
2273	1353500310713	3	lenfifteen ratingthree it seems as though it has become worse the longer i have been using it.
2274	1353498360195	5	lenfour ratingfive great app highly recommend.
2275	1353494019073	4	lenten ratingfour in fact i'm using swiftkey to type this review.
2276	1353494019073	4	leneighteen ratingfour i find the keyboard buttons more accommodating than on the default (jb 4.1.1) hold-for-punctuation key is great.
2277	1353494019073	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour though the stock keyboard has this as well, i think swiftkey did one better by distributing the special chars across more keys.
2278	1353494019073	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour prediction feature is snappy as it doesn't ask for permission to add to dictionary every time there's a new word.
2279	1353494019073	4	lentwentyone ratingfour my one complaint is that the accent char (usually with "~") is missing on uk keyboard as far as i can tell.
2280	1353491211435	3	leneight ratingthree its getting laggier very single update they released.
2281	1353491211435	3	leneleven ratingthree usually takes a few seconds to keep up with my speed.
2282	1353490570948	5	leneighteen ratingfive i have used many other keyboards and o have not been able to find one that comes close.
2283	1353490570948	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive make sure to take the long press time way down so you won't need to ever switch to the other screens!
2284	1353489401645	3	lennine ratingthree i miss the classic alphanumeric kbd on portrait mode.
2285	1353479924646	5	lenfour ratingfive amazing and so clever!
2286	1353477632465	5	leneight ratingfive any other keyboard just doesn't cut it.
2287	1353476750807	5	lensixteen ratingfive there is no better keyboard in terms of feel; how it feels to type with swiftkey!
2288	1353476750807	5	lenthirtysix ratingfive i would like to request two additions though: 1) to press anywhere in a word and be able to edit the whole word from that spot, not just the part of the word that's before it.
2289	1353476750807	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive 2) an option for the galaxy note/2 (and maybe other devices) with the ability to switch to a stylus friendly space where you can write out words like in the samsung keyboard available for the note 2!
2290	1353475738705	5	leneleven ratingfive i hated typing on my phone until i got this app.
2291	1353472774987	5	lenten ratingfive best keyboard, unbelievanly accurate prediction, and it now has swype.
2292	1353472774987	5	leneleven ratingfive you have nothing to lose and everything to gain with swiftkey
2293	1353472674036	5	lenten ratingfive this is by far the best keyboard app for android.
2294	1353472674036	5	lenfour ratingfive well worth the investment.
2295	1353472674036	5	lentwo ratingfive samsung nexus.
2296	1353472406200	5	lenthree ratingfive absolutely fantastic app.
2297	1353472406200	5	lenfour ratingfive well worth the money.
2298	1353472406200	5	lenten ratingfive my typing has improved massively in both accuracy and speed.
2299	1353472102665	2	lenseven ratingtwo this keyboard is pretty good in general.
2300	1353472102665	2	leneight ratingtwo but it is lacking in languages it supports.
2301	1353472102665	2	leneight ratingtwo realised it doesn't support chinese after buying.
2302	1353472102665	2	lenfive ratingtwo please include chinese for this.
2303	1353469429137	5	lenfortyone ratingfive i just got this yesterday, i had my doubts just like anyother key board and at first it was to me then i realized i wasnt even typing the whole word when i was texting lol and now i cant stop!
2304	1353469429137	5	lentwelve ratingfive its hands down a great app and would recommend it to anyone.
2305	1353469429137	5	lenten ratingfive the only problem i have is the themes, needs more.
2306	1353467420895	2	lenfour ratingtwo more themes plz update
2307	1353465709185	5	leneleven ratingfive best typing system so much better than the standard samsung one
2308	1353464082781	1	lenseven ratingone enabling swiftkey makes my phone freeze frequently.
2309	1353462638528	5	lennineteen ratingfive if you do not have this app and you text a lot then you are missing out hands down
2310	1353458603915	5	lennineteen ratingfive save me a lot of time when typing, excellent predictions, excellent performance using two languages at the same time.
2311	1353458603915	5	lensix ratingfive in my case spanish and english.
2312	1353458603915	5	lennine ratingfive first app i bought, the developer deserves that buck.
2313	1353457681532	5	lentwentythree ratingfive please add a casual black and blue theme (like the dark theme, but blue) and a black and red theme would be nice!
2314	1353457681532	5	lenseven ratingfive great app i love it a lot.
2315	1353454479178	5	lennine ratingfive this keyboard does a great job with its predictions.
2316	1353454479178	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i love when it knows the entire text i am trying to send! it is rather pricey, but definitely worth it!
2317	1353452569830	5	lensixteen ratingfive awesome, wish i could get more theams, but as close to perfect as you can get
2318	1353450152899	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive google's ics keyboard isn't bad, but besides that i have never used another keyboard that even compares to this one.
2319	1353450152899	5	lensixteen ratingfive i love the swipe to delete a word, and building sentences with the predictions and laughing.
2320	1353450152899	5	lensix ratingfive well worth the money i paid.
2321	1353450152899	5	lentwenty ratingfive update: lately when i open the keyboard sometimes the predictions don't show up until i close and reopen it.
2322	1353450152899	5	lentwelve ratingfive still love the keyboard on all my devices, but it's annoying.
2323	1353446926804	3	lentwentyone ratingthree great keyboard but there is no way to enable handwriting recognition by either pressing a button or removing the s-pen.
2324	1353446926804	3	lensixteen ratingthree also needs option for dedicated number row at the top like on the stock note 2 keyboard.
2325	1353446926804	3	leneight ratingthree everything functions wonderfully but badly needs these features.
2326	1353588539430	5	lennine ratingfive this keyboard is excellent and just keeps getting smarter!
2327	1353580091033	1	lennine ratingone the auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous.
2328	1353580091033	1	lenseven ratingone allow the option to turn it off.
2329	1353580091033	1	lenfifteen ratingone if you haven't tried a.i.type keyboard, then you're seriously missing out.
2330	1353577263970	4	lenseven ratingfour i hear of a swype-like feature .
2331	1353577263970	4	lenthirteen ratingfour but is it on this version or a different app from swiftkey altogether.
2332	1353577263970	4	lenseven ratingfour want that one but am happy with swfky3 .
2333	1353576894484	3	lennineteen ratingthree 1.still no chinese language support 2.occasional hangs 3.frequently used punctuations a hit n miss affair with the sliding gesture.
2334	1353576894484	3	lenfour ratingthree prefer a dedicated key.
2335	1353576894484	3	lenten ratingthree 4.currency sign is pounds simply because i prefer uk spellings?
2336	1353576894484	3	lenthree ratingthree cant be changed.
2337	1353574748671	5	leneighteen ratingfive predictions for contracted i phrases sometimes work, sometimes don't. it's still worth 5 stars though, great keyboard.
2338	1353569073032	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this app!
2339	1353566978767	5	lenfifty ratingfive love this app makes my phone stand out one thing i would love to see is a light shimmering affect that would work its way across the key board with different shimmer colors that said this iseasilythe best in the world maybe a few more colors for your key board.
2340	1353564991625	5	lenfive ratingfive awesome for lazies like me
2341	1353558370610	3	lenseventeen ratingthree the keyboard focuses too much on correcting errors, and not enough on correctly detecting the correct keypress.
2342	1353558370610	3	lenseventeen ratingthree with swiftkey, i have alot more typing errors (albeit corrected by swiftkey) than with the samsung keyboard.
2343	1353555519477	5	leneleven ratingfive i had a messaging phone cause i hate touch screen keyboards.
2344	1353555519477	5	lenten ratingfive i downloaded this and now i use the screen only.
2345	1353554332002	3	lenfive ratingthree it make me type faster.
2346	1353554332002	3	lenfive ratingthree but the themes are lame.
2347	1353554332002	3	lenten ratingthree wish they would add some new schemes for the themes.
2348	1353554332002	3	lenfour ratingthree gets boring very quickly.
2349	1353543944462	5	lentwentyone ratingfive . one can purchase for any android touch screen device, maybe of any touch screen system at all; i can't say.
2350	1353543944462	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive what i can say as an android touch screen user is that this the best piece of mobile software that i have ever downloaded.
2351	1353543944462	5	lennine ratingfive it has saved me over 60,000 key strokes to date.
2352	1353543944462	5	lensix ratingfive that is a fantasticly huge amount.
2353	1353543944462	5	leneight ratingfive try to just tap at your screen 60,000 times.
2354	1353543944462	5	lenten ratingfive your battery will die many times over before you finish.
2355	1353543944462	5	lenten ratingfive time is arguably priceless and swiftkey has saved me much.
2356	1353539840693	5	leneight ratingfive could you add a new theme "red neon"
2357	1353539840693	5	leneleven ratingfive just like the blue neon (which is great by the way).
2358	1353539840693	5	leneight ratingfive other than that it's an awesome keyboard!
2359	1353538445804	5	lenfive ratingfive way better than go keyboard.
2360	1353538445804	5	lensix ratingfive uses a little less resources, also.
2361	1353538445804	5	lenthree ratingfive customizations are perfect.
2362	1353538445804	5	lennine ratingfive it really learns how you type & what you say.
2363	1353537313336	4	leneleven ratingfour awesome keyboard and use it as my default keyboard on my s3.
2364	1353537313336	4	lentwenty ratingfour but needs an option to increase the space bar key as i find it a little on the small side.
2365	1353537236321	3	lentwenty ratingthree can u make it so when u use the second tab to have the numbers across the top like normal.
2366	1353537190773	5	lenseven ratingfive you will not regret buying this app.
2367	1353537190773	5	lenfive ratingfive easy, efficient and absolutely brilliant!
2368	1353537190773	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i've installed it on android and tab and can not function without it!
2369	1353535988443	5	lensixteen ratingfive the only thing i would change is to add an option for automatic updates for personalization.
2370	1353533350439	3	lenseven ratingthree will not stay as my default keyboard.
2371	1353533350439	3	lentwentynine ratingthree i have used this app for a long time with no problems, but now, since the last couple of updates, it keeps going back to my phones original keyboard.
2372	1353533350439	3	lentwo ratingthree motorola photon
2373	1353532384728	3	lenfortytwo ratingthree i dont kno what yall did but the spacing is messed up now and there is 3 blank squares so now every word i type im pressing the wrong letter than i expect to hit like all letters got shifted to the left.
2374	1353532384728	3	leneleven ratingthree love the themes and features just fix whatever yall screwed up.
2375	1353530750999	3	lenthirteen ratingthree please add emoji there is alot of free keyboards have the emoji symbols :-$
2376	1353530191177	4	lenthirteen ratingfour would be nice to be able to adjust intensity as well as duration.
2377	1353528734497	5	lenten ratingfive great program to be able to type without major complications
2378	1353525927270	1	lennine ratingone i used free version i just fell in love.
2379	1353525927270	1	lennine ratingone hated chatting bcoz cudnt type fast on touch keyboard.
2380	1353525927270	1	lenfive ratingone ppl say i'm changed.
2381	1353525927270	1	lenfifteen ratingone in simple words swiftkey really changed my life n saved a lot of my time.
2382	1353525927270	1	lentwenty ratingone but wen i purchased n removed old app my all saved stats gone.wtever swift learnt from me is lost.
2383	1353525927270	1	lentwo ratingone dats baddd.
2384	1353525927270	1	lenfive ratingone plz do smting fr dis.
2385	1353525927270	1	lennine ratingone did this happen to all who purchased da app.
2386	1353525104867	3	leneighteen ratingthree needs some heavy fixing with lag issues on sgs3, also force closes whe editing tags in tumblr app posts
2387	1353524709065	5	leneight ratingfive recently came across your app and its amazing.
2388	1353524709065	5	lenthirtyseven ratingfive i did not believe how much of an effect would indeed having and now after only having used it for 24 hours i can honestly say that i'll be using it for the rest of my life.
2389	1353524709065	5	lenseventeen ratingfive when i initially got my gs3 it would simply not type what i was typing, it was insane.
2390	1353524709065	5	lenten ratingfive swiftkey is a god-send! keep on fighting the fight!
2391	1353521391372	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour this was the first keyboard i used on my phone when i got it, and it'll probably be the last one i use too.
2392	1353521391372	4	lenfourteen ratingfour everything just works, customizable to cater to any performance needs as well as aestheticly.
2393	1353521391372	4	leneighteen ratingfour i have one simple request i think would be an amazing addition to an already incredibly performing app.
2394	1353521391372	4	lentwenty ratingfour add a feature to slide the directional keys from the bottom so they don't get accidently hit whilst typing.
2395	1353521391372	4	lenseven ratingfour that is literally my only complaint lol.
2396	1353521391372	4	lenfour ratingfour add for five stars!
2397	1353520968558	1	lennine ratingone good for english and waste money for cyrillics layout
2398	1353520231792	4	lentwentythree ratingfour best prediction out there, but it mysteriously starts to lag (a bit) when there is a lot of text in the text field.
2399	1353520231792	4	lennine ratingfour especially strange because i'm using a one x+.
2400	1353674028546	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome keyboard.
2401	1353674028546	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i've been using it through many of my android devices but this time i bought it  .
2402	1353673571861	5	lenfiftythree ratingfive got the trial, tryed a few other keyboards when it ran out, nothing can compare, has increased my typing efficiency by 47%, or so says the cool stat sheet, awsome predictions/corrections, nice themes, works well sideways, first thing i've ever bought from the app market., well worth it, 5 star all the way.
2403	1353672404850	5	lensixteen ratingfive they are also introducing a swype-style feature soon, which will make this the ultimate keyboard.
2404	1353670884797	5	leneleven ratingfive make a deal with them and make this your s3 default keyboard.
2405	1353670884797	5	lenfour ratingfive way faster than swype.
2406	1353669115469	5	lennine ratingfive i used free version i just fell in love.
2407	1353669115469	5	lennine ratingfive hated chatting bcoz cudnt type fast on touch keyboard.
2408	1353669115469	5	lenfive ratingfive ppl say i'm changed.
2409	1353669115469	5	lenfifteen ratingfive in simple words swiftkey really changed my life n saved a lot of my time.
2410	1353669115469	5	lentwenty ratingfive but wen i purchased n removed old app my all saved stats gone.wtever swift learnt from me is lost.
2411	1353669115469	5	lentwo ratingfive dats baddd.
2412	1353669115469	5	lenfive ratingfive plz do smting fr dis.
2413	1353669115469	5	lennine ratingfive did this happen to all who purchased da app.
2414	1353668632486	5	lenten ratingfive would love it if auto correct could be turned off.
2415	1353666512425	1	lenfourteen ratingone wonderful, but no matter what height chosen, the landscape keyboard covers the whole display.
2416	1353666512425	1	leneight ratingone you just see the keyboard and nothing else.
2417	1353665364209	4	lentwentyone ratingfour what about being able to learn from whatsapp as i do most of the typing there (most of the people do).
2418	1353665364209	4	lensix ratingfour we also need italian keyboard layout
2419	1353665157064	5	lenseven ratingfive it can predict my text very well!
2420	1353665157064	5	lenseven ratingfive didn't regret paying for this app.
2421	1353665157064	5	lenfive ratingfive looking forward to swiftkey flow
2422	1353664542332	5	lentwentynine ratingfive all the reviews on this keyboard are pretty accurate this keyboard is accurate, and that's one thing i missed about my old iphone, this keyboard seems even better.
2423	1353664542332	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i love the accuracy of i love the way you can change the themes.
2424	1353664542332	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i see why this is the number one payed app on the market.
2425	1353664542332	5	lennineteen ratingfive i'm a fast typer and it amazes me as i look back how and see no typo problems.
2426	1353664542332	5	lenfourteen ratingfive with the stock samsung keyboard i always had to go back and correct things.
2427	1353664542332	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this keyboard is awesome & if you don't have it your missing out.
2428	1353663254665	5	lensix ratingfive buy it totally worth the money!
2429	1353662728925	5	lennine ratingfive could u set the numeric pad in the middle?
2430	1353662728925	5	lentwelve ratingfive it's hard to type on the opposite side of the screen
2431	1353662081926	4	lentwo ratingfour great application.
2432	1353661632809	1	lenthirteen ratingone worked fine for a while, but some update broke it completely for me.
2433	1353661632809	1	leneighteen ratingone my use case: type something and select one of the three suggestions on the top of the keyboard.
2434	1353661632809	1	lennineteen ratingone in my scenario (three languages, de/en_us/he) this fails a lot (i think mostly with german words).
2435	1353661632809	1	lennineteen ratingone type something, select the completion and the current text isn't replaced with the selected word, but removed entirely.
2436	1353661632809	1	lennineteen ratingone combining multiple languages in one keyboard (one for de/en_us instead of two different) is crap as well.
2437	1353661145355	5	lensix ratingfive it's predictions are amazingly accurate.
2438	1353660315746	1	leneight ratingone phones keeps hanging and crashing after last update
2439	1353657352186	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive i never thought i'd prefer a touchscreen keyboard over a physical one, but this app has changed my perception of software keyboards and how they should work.
2440	1353657352186	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive its prediction engine is amazing, you can type very quickly and sloppily and the autocorrect will work well almost all the time.
2441	1353657352186	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive if you allow it to, it can learn your writing style based on your sent emails, texts, facebook and twitter posts, which tunes the prediction engine to your unique style of writing.
2442	1353657352186	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommended!
2443	1353657015095	3	lentwentyfive ratingthree not sure why but i'm experiencing lag on swiftx 3 lately :( getting quite annoying,  i'd hit a key dead on and get no response
2444	1353655971119	4	lentwo ratingfour great app.
2445	1353654960241	5	lenten ratingfive and i just had it learn them too -_- anyone else?
2446	1353654960241	5	lentwentyone ratingfive space after comma or period is hit and miss. please make it easier to delete words that were saved on accident.
2447	1353654960241	5	lenfive ratingfive so confusing to delete words.
2448	1353654960241	5	leneleven ratingfive some are so easy, others don't even give the option.
2449	1353654960241	5	lenseven ratingfive why does it capitalize words like page?
2450	1353654960241	5	lenfour ratingfive delete words still please
2451	1353651120554	1	lensixteen ratingone title says it all, it works great on android 2.2 but will only work sporadically on android 4.1.
2452	1353651120554	1	lensix ratingone the predictive text is the problem.
2453	1353651120554	1	leneleven ratingone unfortunately i have to stop using this until it is fixed.
2454	1353649856166	3	lenthirtysix ratingthree i'm trying to keep this because i really liked it at first but this lag of type 10 words and it's still typing one letter at a time on the first word back  is frustrating.
2455	1353649835336	5	lenthirteen ratingfive only thing it's missing is more themes; can't wait for flow.
2456	1353649581799	3	leneleven ratingthree very nice keyboard but only thing lacking is choice of themes.
2457	1353649581799	3	leneight ratingthree almost all themes are with closely spaced keys.
2458	1353649581799	3	leneighteen ratingthree you guys shud add more themes like sony keyboard style or iphone style or stock android jellybean look
2459	1353649547544	4	lennineteen ratingfour loving this keyboard so far, would give it 5 stars except that there is no support for chinese typing yet.
2460	1353649547544	4	lensix ratingfour if this is added then 5 stars
2461	1353648712186	5	lenfifteen ratingfive with swype continuing to get worse i thought i'd give this one a bash.
2462	1353648712186	5	lennine ratingfive so glad that i did as it's amazing.
2463	1353648712186	5	lenfourteen ratingfive much quicker than swype because i don't need to correct things as much.
2464	1353645169152	5	lensix ratingfive i often type constantly switching languages.
2465	1353645169152	5	leneighteen ratingfive this is able to correct and predict even when if i were to mix them in one sentence!
2466	1353645169152	5	lentwo ratingfive great job.
2467	1353645128741	5	lenten ratingfive i purchased a new samsung gs2 to replace an older phone.
2468	1353645128741	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i was loving everything about my new phone until i began sending texts and realized that the stock keyboard was totally worthless.
2469	1353645128741	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i seriously considered returning the phone, since sending text messages had become such a chore.
2470	1353645128741	5	leneighteen ratingfive i had previously owned an htc phone and it had the types of features that swift key has.
2471	1353645128741	5	leneleven ratingfive once i installed swift key, i loved my new phone again.
2472	1353645128741	5	lentwentyone ratingfive swift key totally rocks, i have showed it to a number of friends and they have all been amazed by it.
2473	1353643471780	5	lentwelve ratingfive i previously had an htc phone and loved the keyboard on it.
2474	1353643471780	5	lenthirteen ratingfive while i love my new samsung, i hated the keyboard it came with.
2475	1353643471780	5	lenseventeen ratingfive this comes pretty close to the htc keyboard, and the corrections and predictions are even more accurate.
2476	1353643471780	5	lenfourteen ratingfive get the trial first to make sure you like it, but i love it.
2477	1353761025026	1	lentwentythree ratingone this app didn't work on my old se x10i and now i've upgraded to a galaxy nexus it still doesn't. really?
2478	1353761025026	1	lensix ratingone this is the best android replacement?
2479	1353761025026	1	lennineteen ratingone it's dire on my samsung galaxy nexus if i press the space bar i get an i inserted?
2480	1353761025026	1	leneleven ratingone the predictive words thing does not work on my stock browser?
2481	1353759722554	4	lentwentyone ratingfour was loving this, but since the os update on my samsung galaxy s2, i've had a lot more auto-correct mistakes.
2482	1353757475958	4	leneleven ratingfour writing an extended post on fb, i then somehow lost it.
2483	1353757475958	4	leneighteen ratingfour i was amazed how swift key actually remembered the whole paragraph without having to type every word again.
2484	1353757475958	4	lenfifteen ratingfour overall it doesn't always pick the words you want but it's close enough.
2485	1353755216936	5	lenten ratingfive this app turns a phone into a genuine pocket computer.
2486	1353755216936	5	lenseven ratingfive i couldn't live without it now.
2487	1353755216936	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i'd love to be able to give feedback to the developers though.
2488	1353755216936	5	lensixteen ratingfive minor niggles are: please make apostrophes, colons and semi-colons behave like commas and full stops.
2489	1353755216936	5	lensix ratingfive ie automatic changing of space position.
2490	1353755216936	5	leneleven ratingfive apostrophes could be dealt with better too with respect to prompting.
2491	1353755216936	5	leneight ratingfive overall a massive improvement over the android keyboard.
2492	1353754383020	5	lentwo ratingfive absolutely amazing!
2493	1353754383020	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommended.
2494	1353754033712	5	lentwo ratingfive worth purchasing
2495	1353753705373	4	lenfour ratingfour genuinely a fantastic keyboard.
2496	1353753705373	4	lenthree ratingfour thoroughly recommend this.
2497	1353753480665	4	lenfour ratingfour grab over the sale.
2498	1353753480665	4	lenseven ratingfour pretty disappointed due to no android emoji.
2499	1353753480665	4	leneight ratingfour can't you make to option to themes?
2500	1353753480665	4	lensix ratingfour just like auto mode n' manual?
2501	1353753480665	4	lentwentyone ratingfour i mean in auto mode on system time ( or custom time setting or light sensor)  change between 2  themes that user selected.
2502	1353753480665	4	leneight ratingfour manual mode having all the time users selection.
2503	1353753480665	4	lenseven ratingfour just because i always use dark theme.
2504	1353753480665	4	lenseven ratingfour but it not best option in sunlight.
2505	1353752159056	5	lenthirteen ratingfive coming from the stock experience it takes a day or so to adjust.
2506	1353749330280	4	lennine ratingfour this app would be perfect if chinese is included.
2507	1353748447005	5	lenten ratingfive this app allows you to look good with touch type.
2508	1353748447005	5	lenfour ratingfive no cash on samsung s3
2509	1353746526920	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive i had a iphone and this is a really challenger to that sms system, only downside is that you can't add words to dictionary
2510	1353745904906	5	lenfive ratingfive love this & the tablet version!
2511	1353745904906	5	lenfive ratingfive easy to use & very intuitive.
2512	1353744565061	5	lentwentythree ratingfive if you're a fast typer like me and hate having to fix auto correct errors then this is the app for you.
2513	1353744565061	5	lennine ratingfive this app pretty much finishes your sentences for you.
2514	1353744565061	5	lenfive ratingfive incredibly smart, simple and customizable.
2515	1353744485372	5	lenten ratingfive samsung galaxg s3 i tried the trial and then uninstalled it.
2516	1353744485372	5	lentwenty ratingfive that only lasted a few days - i got out the credit card and made the purchase (for half price, too).
2517	1353744485372	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i really, really wanted to find a free keyboard, but nothing events and came close.
2518	1353744485372	5	lennineteen ratingfive this thing is really smart, and i spend more time on the predicted list than i do punching letters.
2519	1353744485372	5	lenseven ratingfive makes texting and composing emails super fast.
2520	1353743468485	3	leneleven ratingthree good work on predictions but the keys should work more efficiently.
2521	1353743468485	3	lenthirtyone ratingthree maybe an algorithm that undesrtands without typing that after r i want to type an e instead of a w and give e a little more virtual space on the backend
2522	1353742545595	3	lenfour ratingthree in the tablet version :(
2523	1353741766344	5	lennine ratingfive i'm writing so fast and smooth right now.
2524	1353741766344	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard!
2525	1353741766344	5	leneight ratingfive you only need to make it more customizable.
2526	1353741026001	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard i've ever used
2527	1353739807537	5	lenthirtysix ratingfive yo vengo de la aplicaci¨®n swipe, pero este me gusto mucho m¨¢s ya que la predicci¨®n de palabra es sumamente incre¨ªble, yo uso mi tel¨¦fono horizontalmente a la hora de escribir ya que me encuentro bien inc¨®modo escribir de la otra manera.
2528	1353739807537	5	lenfortythree ratingfive en tan s¨®lo unos minutos me he acostumbrado a este teclado lo cual marca la diferencia con el swipe el cual me tom¨® varios d¨ªas en aprenderlo, pero la gran diferencia entre las dos aplicaciones es la manera de como reconoce y elige la palabra correcta.
2529	1353738395476	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo ever since i downloaded this thing it has a mind of its own.
2530	1353738395476	2	lennine ratingtwo it won't let me post comments on facebook.
2531	1353738395476	2	lennine ratingtwo it won't let me post in chat rooms.
2532	1353738395476	2	leneleven ratingtwo and if/when it finally does work it force closes suddenly.
2533	1353738395476	2	lensixteen ratingtwo maybe it's just me but my phone seems to be lagging like crazy as well.
2534	1353738395476	2	lenfive ratingtwo please look into this issue.
2535	1353738395476	2	leneleven ratingtwo on a good note the word prediction is extremely important accurate.
2536	1353738088574	5	leneight ratingfive recommend this to everyone who owns a smartphone
2537	1353737218981	4	lennine ratingfour me gustar¨ªa que le a¨¾idiece mas emociones gr¨¢ficas ala hora de textiar :-)
2538	1353736519874	5	lensix ratingfive i decided for 2 bucks why not.
2539	1353736519874	5	lenseven ratingfive i this is definitely worth full price.
2540	1353736519874	5	leneight ratingfive best keyboard, better than the built in s3 version.
2541	1353735076965	5	lenthirteen ratingfive previously i used to reserve works that require excessive typing to my laptop.
2542	1353735076965	5	lenfifteen ratingfive but now i prefer my mob and the only reason for it is this app.
2543	1353735076965	5	lenfour ratingfive waiting for swiftkey flow!
2544	1353734184537	5	lenfifteen ratingfive just purchased a droid maxx hd, and swiftkey is still better than the default keyboard.
2545	1353734096709	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome keyboard.
2546	1353734096709	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i bought it even without trying the free version and now i'm never switching keyboards again.
2547	1353733680294	5	lenfour ratingfive excelente great job guys
2548	1353733554963	3	lenfifteen ratingthree one would think it would work well with google products but is far from it.
2549	1353733554963	3	lentwenty ratingthree i use google chrome a lot and it crashes a lot as well and it's because of this keyboard.
2550	1353733554963	3	lentwentyfour ratingthree the keyboard is quite customizable and has a lot of options that makes it a product you can't miss on your android device.
2551	1353732345169	1	lenfive ratingone never updated with new features.
2552	1353844345352	5	lenseven ratingfive the best keyboard application on the market!
2553	1353843120442	5	lennine ratingfive let's see how it plays out over time .
2554	1353840937367	4	lenseventeen ratingfour i've used this keyboard for years but now android 4.2 features swipe i've stopped using it.
2555	1353840937367	4	leneight ratingfour too bad, the keyboard itself is very good.
2556	1353840937367	4	lennineteen ratingfour only problem i ever had was that it often capitalizes words it shouldn't. like the dutch word "door"
2557	1353840937367	4	lenseventeen ratingfour perhaps implement swipe that works as well as google's implementation and i'll try it again?
2558	1353838521615	3	lentwentyone ratingthree it's good but it don't stay as default keyboard i have to go into settings and put it back
2559	1353837782985	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome app!
2560	1353837528204	4	lenten ratingfour awesome for email, sms, whatsapp, note taking, etc. thumbs up!
2561	1353836874165	5	leneight ratingfive this is the greatest keyboard on the market
2562	1353835424767	5	lentwelve ratingfive i was uncertain about buying a third party keyboard app like this.
2563	1353835424767	5	lensix ratingfive i mean they all suck, right?
2564	1353835424767	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive swiftkey lets me throw my fingers in the key's general direction, and whether or not i hit the right ones it almost always seems to know what i'm looking for.
2565	1353835424767	5	lenseventeen ratingfive hit more incorrect keys than correct keys, and dont hit spacebar for three words in a row?
2566	1353835424767	5	lentwenty ratingfive yeah, it already knows what you wanted to say  google needs to make this prediction system standard, it's amazing!
2567	1353833352839	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive i'm real clumsy when it comes to typing but swiftkey knows what i want to type and it corrects everything with really great accuracy!
2568	1353833352839	5	lentwentyone ratingfive my only gripe is that it doesn't have more black themed keyboard for us amoled screen users (to save power!).
2569	1353833352839	5	leneight ratingfive the neon theme is getting a little old.
2570	1353829524425	5	leneight ratingfive this app is the king of android keyboards.
2571	1353829524425	5	lensix ratingfive you can type nearly 3 times faster!
2572	1353829501495	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome keyboard.
2573	1353829501495	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i've been using it through many of my android devices but this time i bought it.
2574	1353829501495	5	leneleven ratingfive it crashes every time when i add tags into tumblr app.
2575	1353828599941	5	lentwelve ratingfive swiftkey is just one of those apps you need on your phone.
2576	1353828599941	5	lenthirteen ratingfive their intelligent learning process is what makes this a step above the rest.
2577	1353828599941	5	lentwelve ratingfive worth every penny because of the amount of time it saves you.
2578	1353827661523	4	lensix ratingfour this is a solid keyboard app.
2579	1353827661523	4	leneleven ratingfour a must have for any touch smartphone not just android phones.
2580	1353827661523	4	lentwenty ratingfour loses a star because a) should be the default keyboard for android phones really and b) no swype feature yet.
2581	1353827661523	4	lenfourteen ratingfour but all in all love it and took advantage of the $1.99 thanksgiving sale price.
2582	1353826889412	5	lenfortyfour ratingfive this keyboard is the answer to my prayers i'm so in love with it but my only complaint is the themes they look like an old lady made them yes the neon is the best but it's kinda hard on the eyes.
2583	1353826250022	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive i got my galaxy s3 recently and was worried about not having a physical keyboard, but with this app, my typing speed and accuracy are almost same as having a physical keyboard!
2584	1353826250022	5	lenseven ratingfive no more frustration and bunch of typos.
2585	1353826250022	5	lennine ratingfive not much customizations but i'm ok with that.
2586	1353822230997	4	lenthirtythree ratingfour i just wish they would come out with a lot more themes or give option to install custom made themes by other people please make new themes or ler us customize our own
2587	1353820624349	1	leneleven ratingone swipe much better your insane if you don't think so.
2588	1353820160748	3	lensix ratingthree i wish it was swype capable
2589	1353816597327	4	lenten ratingfour been using for a day and so far loving it.
2590	1353816597327	4	lentwelve ratingfour makes it possible to type without concentrating on hitting the right characters.
2591	1353816597327	4	lenten ratingfour only if there were more options to customize the ui.
2592	1353816597327	4	lentwenty ratingfour got no use for smileys, instead i'd like to bind that to open the second page of special characters.
2593	1353815746728	4	lentwelve ratingfour needs a quick text option and the ability to edit the smileys.
2594	1353815746728	4	lennine ratingfour i type faster with this keyboard than any other.
2595	1353814273990	5	leneighteen ratingfive i tried the free trial then had to buy it because i couldnt type without lots of errors
2596	1353813037497	5	lenten ratingfive excellent app and a huge improvement over the stock keyboard.
2597	1353813037497	5	lennine ratingfive had a windows phone which has a great keyboard.
2598	1353813037497	5	lenseven ratingfive switched to android and hated the keyboard.
2599	1353813037497	5	lensix ratingfive with this app, phone is awesome!
2600	1353811688501	4	leneighteen ratingfour swiftkey is one of the first apps i make sure i install when flashing to a new rom.
2601	1353811688501	4	lentwentyeight ratingfour one thing i miss from a previous version is the ability to customize the amount of keyboard that needs to be swiped before the previous word gets deleted.
2602	1353811688501	4	lentwentyseven ratingfour there are many times where what i've typed gets deleted because my fingers move fast enough to where the two touches are registered as a swipe.
2603	1353811688501	4	lentwentyone ratingfour having an option to back up settings to the external sd would be nice, as well as getting vietnamese language support.
2604	1353809861535	1	leneight ratingone it removed my emoticons and it predicts crap.
2605	1353809366647	5	lensixteen ratingfive this is a intelligent keyboard and very much easier to use i highly recommend this keyboard.
2606	1353809354630	4	lenthree ratingfour love the app.
2607	1353809354630	4	lentwentysix ratingfour it is very smart and very handy to the fast texter, just hope then come up with more custom keyboards and maybe even a holiday one.
2608	1353809354630	4	lenfive ratingfour anyways thanks again great app.
2609	1353934429511	5	lenten ratingfive please also support hinglish (hindi+english) many keyboards support that
2610	1353929106015	2	lensixteen ratingtwo i got this keyboard for a korean english typing use but it really bugs out ez.
2611	1353929106015	2	lennine ratingtwo it just minimizes randomly when i type too fast.
2612	1353929106015	2	lentwentyeight ratingtwo also i wish u couls get rid of certain keys and customize it because its way too diff for emoticon input (ie. ^_^) well back to google keyboard ics
2613	1353927682435	5	lennine ratingfive really enjoying typing on my phone with this keyboard.
2614	1353927682435	5	lenten ratingfive just needs swype feature and it can't be beat.
2615	1353927682435	5	lenthirteen ratingfive need to add an option not to predict sentence opening upon hitting space.
2616	1353926459895	1	lenseven ratingone puts in a space after a period.
2617	1353926459895	1	lenfourteen ratingone even on web and email address' with no option to turn this feature off.
2618	1353926215504	5	lennine ratingfive i used to love swype, but after using swiftkey.
2619	1353926215504	5	lenten ratingfive the time taken for typing messages has been cut by 3/4.
2620	1353926214129	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive nicht nur hat mir das keyboard bereits ¨¹ber 200k tastenanschl?ge gespart und 64k w?rter vorhergesagt, meine produktivit?t hat sich auch um knappe 30 prozent verbessert.
2621	1353926214129	5	lentwentyone ratingfive ein tolles feature ist das 'lernen von sms' was bei mir sehr hilfreich war, da ich viele abge?nderte worte verwende.
2622	1353926214129	5	leneight ratingfive super app zu einem mehr als fairen preis!
2623	1353921003450	1	lenthree ratingone sent crash report
2624	1353918738040	5	lenfour ratingfive a 12 gombos verzi¨® hi¨¢nyzik bel?le!
2625	1353918738040	5	lenone ratingfive am¨²gy nagyon j¨®.
2626	1353913891000	5	lenthree ratingfive good job development.
2627	1353913891000	5	lenthirteen ratingfive a little different but a great getting improvement over the stock android keyboard.
2628	1353913203549	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive if your running a phone and you don't have this app then go and get a cold fish and slap your self, cause its a must have
2629	1353911407882	5	lennine ratingfive it thinks my samsung galaxy note is a tablet
2630	1353907309349	4	lennineteen ratingfour i haven't had any issues with it but i would give 5 stars if it had a swype feature.
2631	1353906093848	4	lenfourteen ratingfour its cool and all but im kind of getting tired of the same themes.
2632	1353906093848	4	lenfifteen ratingfour can yall put new themes plz? other than that it's a very good app.
2633	1353903454303	1	lennine ratingone auto correct doesn't work in any browser anymore.
2634	1353900766242	4	lenseven ratingfour at times have glitches but good app
2635	1353899859413	4	lensixteen ratingfour this is a good app but sometimes it doesn't fix my words when i space.
2636	1353899859413	4	leneight ratingfour you need to integrate the 4.2 swipe into it
2637	1353899263098	5	lenseven ratingfive having a personal dictionary would be great.
2638	1353899263098	5	lenfive ratingfive other then that awesome keyboard.
2639	1353899263098	5	lensix ratingfive i like the numbers pad, convenient.
2640	1353895478165	4	lentwelve ratingfour doesn't work as awesome for me as the free trial did.
2641	1353895478165	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i am typing way more than before to get the word i want
2642	1353891258083	4	lenfive ratingfour sometimes inaccurate with key presses.
2643	1353891258083	4	lensix ratingfour hit the space bar too much.
2644	1353891258083	4	lenfive ratingfour needs more space bar options.
2645	1353889900222	1	lensix ratingone i love everything about this keyboard.
2646	1353889900222	1	lenseven ratingone except the fact it drains my battery.
2647	1353889900222	1	lensix ratingone 84% of battery drain is this app.
2648	1353889900222	1	leneight ratingone it took me a little time to realize.
2649	1353889900222	1	lenseven ratingone id love to continue to use it.
2650	1353889900222	1	lenthirteen ratingone i just dont want to be plugged in 24/7 in order to use it.
2651	1353888632131	4	lentwo ratingfour great app.
2652	1353888632131	4	lenseven ratingfour much better then the samsung galaxy s3 keyboard.
2653	1353888632131	4	lenthree ratingfour worth the money!
2654	1353887794453	2	leneight ratingtwo doesn't learn some words despite multiple entries.
2655	1353887794453	2	leneleven ratingtwo and now it's failing to show the predictive word bar.
2656	1353887794453	2	lentwo ratingtwo galaxy s3 sprint.
2657	1354021031868	5	lenfifteen ratingfive open up more customizable features, like smiley edit/gesture edit & please add chinese language support!
2658	1354019139567	5	lentwentythree ratingfive simply the best, the app's engine is simply amazing, can't wait for the nect update with the included new flow feature :)
2659	1354018064354	4	lenthirty ratingfour this is definitely a must get for android as the original keyboard is really lousy compared to i phone but would rate five stars if emoji and chinese is in
2660	1354015350902	5	lentwo ratingfive genialna klawiatura.
2661	1354015350902	5	lenfive ratingfive dla mnie okaza?a si?
2662	1354015350902	5	lennine ratingfive du?o wygodniejsza i szybsza w dzia?aniu ni?
2663	1354014985992	5	lennine ratingfive this is a major improvement on the base keyboard.
2664	1354013748032	3	lenfourteen ratingthree works great except several times everyday i have to set it as my default.
2665	1354013748032	3	leneleven ratingthree this is proving to be so annoying i have uninstalled it.
2666	1354013748032	3	leneight ratingthree fix this and i will reinstall and rerate.
2667	1354013035073	5	lentwo ratingfive absolute perfect.
2668	1354013035073	5	lenfive ratingfive better than slideit/swype keyboards.
2669	1354012028064	5	lensix ratingfive better if chinese input is supported.
2670	1354011514607	4	lenthirtyseven ratingfour minus one star just cause it crashes down a bit and acts weird at times other than that best keyboard replacement app on the market but its okay cause it is so good most of the times!.
2671	1354011514607	4	lentwelve ratingfour can't wait for swiftkey flow to make it even better :d
2672	1354010876824	5	lensix ratingfive thanks for the malay language pack :-)
2673	1354010475192	1	leneleven ratingone most software that i have on my phone gets updated regularly.
2674	1354010475192	1	lenseven ratingone the one that i actually paid for.
2675	1354010475192	1	leneight ratingone the learning function is not good enough yet.
2676	1354010475192	1	lentwelve ratingone it still doesn't give words suggestions in my phones native browser.
2677	1354010074682	1	lentwenty ratingone got annoyed after they teased us with an upcoming swype like feature and haven't heard anything about it since.
2678	1354010074682	1	lentwentyfour ratingone which doesn't surprise me so i remembered how much i missed swype and how faster it was so i switched back to it.
2679	1354009162430	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i love this app, but i think it's eating up my battery.
2680	1354008174842	4	lenseven ratingfour nice functional keyboard, good predictive word power.
2681	1354005294922	5	lenseven ratingfive better from the stock, and great predictions.
2682	1354004391006	5	lenfour ratingfive this keyboard is awesome.
2683	1354004391006	5	lennine ratingfive have been using it for about a week now.
2684	1354004391006	5	lenten ratingfive the predictive capabilities are fantastic, layout, options and features brilliant.
2685	1354004391006	5	lenfive ratingfive no brainer, just buy it
2686	1354003822734	2	lenthirtyone ratingtwo i am looking forward that swiftkey can develop the simplified cangjie input method quickly =] if it has simplified cangjie input method, i will give swiftkey 5 stars, make an all-out effort.
2687	1354003581405	5	lentwo ratingfive fantastic keyboard.
2688	1354003581405	5	lenfive ratingfive really is worth the cost.
2689	1354003581405	5	lensixteen ratingfive makes you wonder why the default and swype keyboards don't 'think' like this one does.
2690	1354002661365	1	leneleven ratingone the installation is stuck at trying to download the language packs.
2691	1354002661365	1	lenfifteen ratingone tried all fixes including reinstalling the app, clearing cache and data and rebooting the phone.
2692	1354002661365	1	lenseven ratingone would not recommend till this is fixed
2693	1353999814174	3	lennine ratingthree the auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous.
2694	1353999814174	3	lenseven ratingthree allow the option to turn it off.
2695	1353999814174	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree this is one of the highest (3rd) rated suggestions on your feedback/feature requests website and has been for well over a year.
2696	1353999814174	3	lennine ratingthree instead you seem more interested in creating more themes.
2697	1353999814174	3	lenthirteen ratingthree when this gets implemented, i'd be more then happy to give 5 stars.
2698	1353999126210	5	lennine ratingfive this is the best keyboard i've come across.
2699	1353999126210	5	lensix ratingfive typing is not a chore anymore.
2700	1353999126210	5	lentwo ratingfive great stuff!
2701	1353998885646	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive a good app which figures out what you are going to type even before you type the word itself just amazed me.
2702	1353998885646	5	lentwenty ratingfive well would be better if it were a bit more customizable where the user can define the words and shortcuts.
2703	1353998885646	5	lennine ratingfive would recommend to anyone who is into fast typing.
2704	1353998351839	5	leneight ratingfive by far the best keyboard on the market.
2705	1353998351839	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny.
2706	1353997167223	4	lennine ratingfour this keyboard is good and thnx for making it.
2707	1353997167223	4	leneleven ratingfour the one i didn't like is the vibration when typing.
2708	1353993683640	4	lenfive ratingfour i dont make anymore mistakes!
2709	1353993683640	4	lenfour ratingfour just needs more themes!
2710	1353993261284	4	lentwo ratingfour chinese language?
2711	1353993261284	4	lenten ratingfour if not, add a key that allows changing of keyboard.
2712	1353993261284	4	lenthirteen ratingfour it's a big hassle to change keyboard and key my chinese character.
2713	1353993261284	4	lennine ratingfour but the other keyboards allow swift change to swiftkey.
2714	1353993261284	4	leneight ratingfour i believe you guys can make this swift ;)
2715	1354107342562	5	lenfortysix ratingfive was happy with ics keyboard up until now, trialed this just for the colours (which are great)  and curiosity, i think it's a much better keyboard by far, and quick to adapt to- 60 seconds later and i paid the $4, i am not going without this.
2716	1354107342562	5	lensix ratingfive i love it,  thanks dev team!
2717	1354107052947	3	lensix ratingthree this is a decent keyboard app.
2718	1354107052947	3	lenten ratingthree the predicted words database can be pretty impressive at times.
2719	1354107052947	3	lenthirtyfive ratingthree i would absolutely love it if you guys could make an update that would allow the user to be able to type in a swype style format instead of having to punch letter after letter.
2720	1354107052947	3	lensix ratingthree this would seriously speed up typing.
2721	1354107052947	3	lensixteen ratingthree if you could provide this update, i will be more than happy to reevaluate my rating.
2722	1354106934822	5	lentwelve ratingfive this is the best, most accurate, keyboard i have used on android!
2723	1354106322760	5	lennine ratingfive the best and most used app on my galaxy s3.
2724	1354106322760	5	lenten ratingfive very smart predictive text that quickly learns how you talk.
2725	1354106322760	5	lentwentyone ratingfive definitely recommend trying the 1 month trial, you won't be able to go back to the stock keyboard after the trial.
2726	1354104984272	4	lenseventy ratingfour bought this for my s3 and it's brilliant, using it for my nexus7 now, thought i'd try the tab version after seeing they had a sale on, just missed it:-(  now thinking about it, for 3 quid, you should be getting both. won't be paying full rate for the tab version. although a good product, not sure it warrants 6 pounds to have it on phone and tab, hence the 4 stars.
2727	1354101063575	4	lentwentythree ratingfour it's a great keyboard! :-)  would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
2728	1354097320455	5	lenthirteen ratingfive love this keyboard, so much more intuitive than the galaxy s3 built in one.
2729	1354097320455	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive having recently switched from iphone, this is actually the first app i've bought after my trial version expired - couldn't live without it. :)
2730	1354096255934	5	lensix ratingfive it's great i love it.
2731	1354096255934	5	lensix ratingfive needs a pink neon keyboard tho
2732	1354096101405	4	lenten ratingfour can you add the nis symbol to the hebrew keyboard?!?!
2733	1354096101405	4	lenten ratingfour i have a lot of colleagues who requested the same.
2734	1354093391972	5	lensix ratingfive this keyboard is fast, simple, gorgeous!
2735	1354091439712	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive one of the first apps i download when i get a new phone and has been my default keyboard for ages now!
2736	1354091439712	5	lenten ratingfive this is the best keyboard and only keeps getting better!
2737	1354090989382	2	lenthirtysix ratingtwo everything was great , after updating to jellybean stock rom on tmobile i can no longer keep set as my default keyboard , have to set it every time i turn my phone on , getting annoying , please fix
2738	1354090963326	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard app in the market.
2739	1354089068728	3	lennineteen ratingthree the best keyboard but a little glitch when texts come in the keyboard messes up really bad and freezes.
2740	1354089068728	3	lenfifteen ratingthree it needs a button to lower the keyboard instead of having a back space everytime.
2741	1354089068728	3	lenfive ratingthree the keyboard crashes my phone!
2742	1354087493725	4	lenfour ratingfour i love this keyboard.
2743	1354087493725	4	leneleven ratingfour the jelly beans keyboard was good, this is more than awesome.
2744	1354087493725	4	lentwentynine ratingfour no need to do a manual switch between languages, which increase by far productivity especially when half of your contacts in sms or email are in french and english.
2745	1354087493725	4	leneleven ratingfour (update)  since i updated to 4.2, the keyboard has been way slower.
2746	1354087493725	4	lensix ratingfour the stock keyboard is much faster.
2747	1354085959796	2	lensix ratingtwo unable to install after second step.
2748	1354084841651	4	lentwenty ratingfour this keyboard is really good with the exception of not being able to disable the pop-up on key press.
2749	1354084841651	4	lensixteen ratingfour only other thing i would like to see is the ability to colorize the keyboards myself.
2750	1354084841651	4	lentwelve ratingfour smart space works really well and the auto correct works really well.
2751	1354084239427	5	lennine ratingfive so much better than the built in ics keyboard.
2752	1354084239427	5	lenseven ratingfive i wish google would buy this company.
2753	1354082633934	5	lenthirteen ratingfive you really dont know what you are missing if you dont try it.
2754	1354082633934	5	lensixteen ratingfive over the last 3 years i've tried many phones but swift keyboard just works like charm.
2755	1354082633934	5	lensix ratingfive better than all the stock keyboards.
2756	1354082633934	5	lennineteen ratingfive trust me give it a try and you wont allow yourself to get back to the old stock keyboard.
2757	1354082633934	5	lentwentythree ratingfive and finally i cant explain how accurate the word predictions are as in you and your phone share some sort of telepathy powers.
2758	1354082633934	5	lenfive ratingfive beggars belief try it now.
2759	1354082382326	4	lenthree ratingfour needs swipe feature
2760	1354078078916	1	lenfour ratingone more themes plz update
2761	1354078021915	5	lenseventeen ratingfive been using this for years now, still, nothing comes close, but, it slipped a little in predictions.
2762	1354078021915	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i still maintain, if you're using the stock keyboard you're wasting time.
2763	1354076485246	4	lentwo ratingfour great keyboard
2764	1354076307078	1	lensix ratingone the keyboard doesn't learn anymore.
2765	1354076307078	1	lenfourteen ratingone the beauty of swiftkey was it's ability to learn your methods and style.
2766	1354191302853	5	lensix ratingfive always remembers everything i wrote before
2767	1354179391088	5	lenthirty ratingfive i was a keypad guy before i bought a android phone, i was so frustrated by the touch keypad.but after i installed swiftkey.its like a magic.superb app.
2768	1354177362682	4	lenfourteen ratingfour this keyboard has the best prediction out of the other ones i've tried.
2769	1354177362682	4	lenfour ratingfour super easy and quick.
2770	1354177362682	4	lenseventeen ratingfour the only things that would make it better would be more customization options, and add swype capability.
2771	1354177100214	1	lenfourteen ratingone after new update predictions not display good.there is some problem.please fix it
2772	1354171710248	5	leneight ratingfive it's fast, smart, and easy to use.
2773	1354171710248	5	lenthirteen ratingfive swipe left to delete words, down to minimize keyboard, and up to cap.
2774	1354171710248	5	leneight ratingfive and i love the phone style number pad.
2775	1354168488808	5	lentwelve ratingfive i'm a fast typer and this app always corrects my words!
2776	1354168488808	5	leneighteen ratingfive even if you're a precise texter the app has an option for that, and many other options.
2777	1354168488808	5	lentwo ratingfive worth buying!
2778	1354167812165	5	lenfive ratingfive it's worth the money^_^
2779	1354165449960	1	leneleven ratingone seriously what's with them having access to everything we type?
2780	1354162718931	5	lennineteen ratingfive maybe you could make it even better if you could scroll down or across more than just three predictions?
2781	1354162718931	5	lenthree ratingfive like five or 10.
2782	1354162718931	5	lenfour ratingfive would double the speed
2783	1354162253504	2	lenthirtysix ratingtwo everything was great , after updating to jellybean stock rom on tmobile i can no longer keep set as my default keyboard , have to set it every time i turn my phone on , getting annoying , please fix
2784	1354161950810	5	lenthirteen ratingfive you really dont know what you are missing if you dont try it.
2785	1354161950810	5	lensixteen ratingfive over the last 3 years i've tried many phones but swift keyboard just works like charm.
2786	1354161950810	5	lensix ratingfive better than all the stock keyboards.
2787	1354161950810	5	lennineteen ratingfive trust me give it a try and you wont allow yourself to get back to the old stock keyboard.
2788	1354161950810	5	lentwentythree ratingfive and finally i cant explain how accurate the word predictions are as in you and your phone share some sort of telepathy powers.
2789	1354161950810	5	lenfive ratingfive beggars belief try it now.
2790	1354160464054	5	lensix ratingfive and now just waiting for flow.
2791	1354159020095	5	lenfour ratingfive what a great day.
2792	1354159020095	5	lenfive ratingfive to find such wonderful product.
2793	1354159020095	5	lennine ratingfive when i installed the free version of the program.
2794	1354159020095	5	leneight ratingfive i immediately bought the complete version of it.
2795	1354159020095	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it works so fast, easy and good that i will not change it.
2796	1354159020095	5	lenseventeen ratingfive in fact i recommend it to all who want to save time and energy to buy it.
2797	1354159020095	5	lennineteen ratingfive hope this will help many people like me who are wondering what to buy to help themselves in writing.
2798	1354159020095	5	lenfour ratingfive may god bless you!
2799	1354157936082	5	lenten ratingfive my wife has a smart phone from that fruit company.
2800	1354157936082	5	lenten ratingfive she says she wishes swiftkey was available from her store.
2801	1354157936082	5	lenfive ratingfive the predicted text is awesome!
2802	1354156632591	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i love this app for my phone but i'm annoyed i have to buy another version to run on my tablet.
2803	1354156632591	5	lenfifteen ratingfive and what's with not being able to put arrow keys on the tablet version?
2804	1354155997283	5	lensixteen ratingfive this is easily the best keyboard for android right now and it's always being updated.
2805	1354155997283	5	lensixteen ratingfive i'd really like to see a winter/christmas theme like they havr for halloween though.
2806	1354155413620	5	lentwo ratingfive great app
2807	1354155138537	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive i had this on my lg p500 & now i have it on my samsung galaxy s3, it's the best keyboard, super accurate and amazing to be able to personalize!
2808	1354155138537	5	lennine ratingfive would love it if it had more symbols though :)
2809	1354154750272	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i have bought very few apps, and am very stingy when buying one, but after using the trial version im pretty much sold!
2810	1354154750272	5	lennineteen ratingfive if you're dyslexic or just have fat thumbs (both of which i have), this is great for texting!
2811	1354154750272	5	lenthree ratingfive def worth 4 dollars!
2812	1354153322091	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo great, but u should let people know there is no emoji before they buy it!
2813	1354149888458	3	lentwenty ratingthree not the first time the bloody thing outdates all language packs with no warning when i have no network access.
2814	1354147925163	5	lennineteen ratingfive excelent software and it's a powerful and very smart and we are waiting new features  thanks a lot
2815	1354147048062	5	leneleven ratingfive this keyboard seems to have the best prediction and auto correct.
2816	1354147048062	5	lentwelve ratingfive i've used it on my evo 4g and now on my galaxy s3.
2817	1354147048062	5	lensixteen ratingfive the performance wasn't as good on my evo, but it still got the job done.
2818	1354147048062	5	lennine ratingfive the keys just didn't pop up as fast.
2819	1354143174172	4	lenfour ratingfour the keyboard works awesome.
2820	1354143174172	4	lenten ratingfour the only thing it's missing is more character options!
2821	1354141483444	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive there are many different keyboards you can get for your android, i've tried just about all of them but this one is by far the bast.
2822	1354141483444	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommend!
2823	1354141049886	5	lenthirty ratingfive great keyboard, the word prediction is great, the haptic feedback is good, the only thing i wish this keyboard had is gestures typing like the new jelly bean keyboard has.
2824	1354279846483	5	lentwo ratingfive swiftkey keyboard
2825	1354278643529	4	lentwo ratingfour absolutely awesome.
2826	1354278643529	4	leneleven ratingfour this keyboard changed my mind about typing on a touch-screen.
2827	1354278643529	4	lenfortyseven ratingfour the only problem i have with this keyboard is that sometimes it will interpret my fast typing as a deletion swipe, which can be frustrating - but i can put up with it since my typing would take much longer without this keyboard even taking that into account.
2828	1354278643529	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i love the support for multiple dictionaries at the same time, works very well.
2829	1354275399242	5	lenseven ratingfive couldn't find a better keyboard anywhere
2830	1354273886019	3	lensix ratingthree it doesnt work with fb chat.
2831	1354273886019	3	lenfourteen ratingthree which is the ideal situation to make use of fast typing and auto correct.
2832	1354273886019	3	lenseven ratingthree other than that its worth the money.
2833	1354272044978	5	lensix ratingfive combines english and afrikaans keyboards flawlessly!
2834	1354269603678	5	lenfortyfive ratingfive this is on another level than the keyboard that came with my galaxy s3, which was terrible - the only improvement that swiftkey needs is the ability to paste into whatsapp - to do this right now i have to switch to the samsung keyboard and hold the 123?
2835	1354269603678	5	lenthree ratingfive button to paste.
2836	1354268793197	5	lenfifteen ratingfive if you daily have to text in different languages this is the keyboard to get.
2837	1354268793197	5	lenten ratingfive it supports three of them and the utilisation is flawless!
2838	1354268793197	5	lenthree ratingfive a real pleasure.
2839	1354268793197	5	lenseven ratingfive moreover the prediction is scary of accuracy!
2840	1354267037581	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo aggiornando il sistema ad android 4.2 la tastiera scompare da sola (e va reinstallata)
2841	1354265605316	5	lenthree ratingfive very nice appp.
2842	1354265605316	5	lensix ratingfive works like butter on my note.
2843	1354265605316	5	lenthree ratingfive a definite download.
2844	1354263117098	3	lenthirteen ratingthree the keyboard layout is not to my liking and cannot be changed much.
2845	1354263117098	3	lentwelve ratingthree it also learns from emails i didn't write, just replied to!
2846	1354263117098	3	lentwenty ratingthree if i just press space bar many times it writes a long sentence somebody else wrote me in an email.
2847	1354261228750	2	lensix ratingtwo there is a ton if lag!
2848	1354261228750	2	lennineteen ratingtwo i start to type and it doesn't register until seconds later and i've already written a paragraph.
2849	1354261228750	2	lenfive ratingtwo eats a ton of ram.
2850	1354260060187	4	lenfive ratingfour good substitute for stock keyboard.
2851	1354258919567	5	lenthree ratingfive buy this app
2852	1354258154776	1	lenfive ratingone major issues with chrome fields.
2853	1354258154776	1	lenseven ratingone jumps all over the place, erases characters.
2854	1354258154776	1	lenthree ratingone pretty much unusable.
2855	1354258061697	5	lensix ratingfive literally the best keyboard for android.
2856	1354258061697	5	leneleven ratingfive i sell phones, and recommend this to all of my guests.
2857	1354256779316	5	lenthree ratingfive saved my life.
2858	1354256779316	5	lenthree ratingfive thanks a lot
2859	1354255444797	5	leneight ratingfive does great with predicting the next textual input.
2860	1354255444797	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it has a great look and awesome development and innovation with this keyboard.
2861	1354253472927	3	lenfourteen ratingthree personally i find i type less accurately with this keyboard than the stock one.
2862	1354253472927	3	leneight ratingthree also don't like the numbers/characters panel.
2863	1354253472927	3	lenthirteen ratingthree the option to have a more classic looking one wouldn't go amiss.
2864	1354253021344	5	lenfive ratingfive not even the stock ones.
2865	1354253021344	5	lenseven ratingfive but common in wanna see swiftkey flow!
2866	1354250024531	5	lensix ratingfive i would definitely recommend this product.
2867	1354250024531	5	lentwentysix ratingfive it's hard to say all the things that this program does so i will just say try the trial version and you might get hooked.
2868	1354247509578	5	lenthirteen ratingfive awesome keyboard but hopefully there will be han yin pinyin support real soon
2869	1354246353995	5	leneleven ratingfive predictions works amazingly, you have to use 30 days trial to believe.
2870	1354245060647	1	leneight ratingone i've been using this app since june.
2871	1354245060647	1	lensix ratingone i never seen a useful update.
2872	1354245060647	1	lentwentyfive ratingone i posted a review telling that on samsung galaxy note doesn't work very well, it keeps crashing and freezing my messaging app and whatsapp.
2873	1354245060647	1	lentwelve ratingone sometimes i have to wait minetes till i can use it again.
2874	1354245060647	1	leneleven ratingone tryed to delete it and install it again,doesn't work.
2875	1354245060647	1	lenten ratingone i paid almost 4 euro for this, can't be possible.
2876	1354245060647	1	lenseven ratingone can you make a useful update please?
2877	1354245060647	1	leneleven ratingone till that customers, if you have a sgn, don't install.
2878	1354242068652	3	leneighteen ratingthree this is a great keyboard but i have found a.i. type keyboard is faster smoother and cleaner.
2879	1354242068652	3	lennine ratingthree this is still awesome but i've moved on.
2880	1354241936753	3	lenseven ratingthree just does not allow for fat fingers.
2881	1354241936753	3	lenseven ratingthree would love to move space bar right.
2882	1354241936753	3	lenthree ratingthree predictive words annoying 6
2883	1354241401724	4	lenfive ratingfour good app for my note 2    ,.
2884	1354241307843	5	lennine ratingfive i really like how easy it is to use.
2885	1354241293367	5	leneleven ratingfive i've been using this keyboard for over a year now.
2886	1354241293367	5	lennine ratingfive it beats all of the others out hands down.
2887	1354240180216	3	lenforty ratingthree i was not happy with the keyboard after coming from iphone to android until i tried swiftkey, however, i have found quite a few apps that refuse to show the predictive text.like the built in browser on my galaxy s3.
2888	1354240180216	3	lenseventeen ratingthree not sure if it's a setting, but if it is i haven't found it yet.
2889	1354240180216	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree it does show up in chrome at least, but there are some other apps as well that do not seem to work.
2890	1354240180216	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree i will like to see a swipe input (think it's coming) but i'm not 100% sold thats faster for me anyway.
2891	1354240180216	3	lenthirteen ratingthree (add firefox, dolphin to the list of non working browsers with predictive text).
2892	1354240180216	3	lennine ratingthree no reply from the company to address any issues.
2893	1354237467471	3	lentwentysix ratingthree half of the time it's great, but also the other half of the time i feel like throwing my very expensive phone at a wall.
2894	1354237467471	3	lenfifteen ratingthree it seems as though it has become worse the longer i have been using it.
2895	1354358773181	4	lensix ratingfour more languages upgrade would be better. :-)
2896	1354356261577	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i gave it a 4 because i thought it would have more color customization.
2897	1354355088645	1	lenfiftynine ratingone swiftkey could be 5 stars but suggests northumberland and gloucestershire instead of words real people use and it wants to follow julia with roberts and paul with mccartney so swiftkey is completely useless until international english is an option which after all is what 90% of people use and the months go by without any progress despite feedback to the devs .
2898	1354355088645	1	lennine ratingone the recent addition of australian english is completely bizarre.
2899	1354355088645	1	lenfive ratingone it suggests  gillard after julia!
2900	1354355088645	1	lenfive ratingone please please please international english!
2901	1354354262928	1	lenthree ratingone need thai language
2902	1354350152050	5	lennine ratingfive i absolutely love the word predictions this app shows.
2903	1354350152050	5	lenfifteen ratingfive almost all the time,  it would show the next word i was planning to type.
2904	1354350152050	5	lenfourteen ratingfive thank you for your hard work and i look forward to your next update.
2905	1354349143014	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny!
2906	1354348343362	1	lenfive ratingone dude where are the themes!?
2907	1354348343362	1	lentwelve ratingone as in how long do we the paying customers have to wait!?
2908	1354348343362	1	leneight ratingone i'm about to un install real quick.
2909	1354347933645	5	lenseven ratingfive this app means a lot to me.
2910	1354347933645	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i alpha tested this app and the reason i liked it then is still the case now.
2911	1354347933645	5	lenthirty ratingfive this app has gone through some visual and back end changes, but since the beginning and current it does great with predicting the next word that you want to input.
2912	1354347933645	5	lensix ratingfive it is accurate next to none.
2913	1354347933645	5	lentwentythree ratingfive it has a great look and awesome development and innovation with this keyboard that i can say i haven't seen anywhere else.
2914	1354347071813	3	lentwentyfive ratingthree when i just had the trial version the app worked like a charm but now it freezes from time to time for no apparent reason.
2915	1354347071813	3	lenthirtyone ratingthree i am forced to exit the program and start over from the beginning-sending emails is even worse - in landscape view it is almost impossible to see what you are writing
2916	1354346852011	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i love this keyboard and it beats my phone's default one anyday!
2917	1354346852011	4	lennine ratingfour it has a smooth and great interface as well.
2918	1354346852011	4	lenfourteen ratingfour only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that we can't type in chinese!
2919	1354346852011	4	lenthirtyone ratingfour i mean, there's even languages i have never heard of, but not chinese mandarin.oh and another, at times it doesn't automatically autocorrect and a word such as "gjakdn"
2920	1354345510511	1	lentwentyone ratingone tle letter for arabic keyboard is small very difficult to write not like english keyboard english keyboard has an excellent size
2921	1354335266442	5	lensix ratingfive my favourite keyboard on he market.
2922	1354335266442	5	lentwelve ratingfive had it on my samsung admire, and it was great on that.
2923	1354335266442	5	lenfive ratingfive on the galaxy s3 its amazing.
2924	1354335266442	5	lenseventeen ratingfive it's allows me to half-a** typing on my phone as it remembers what i type.
2925	1354335266442	5	lennine ratingfive only thing i'd change is more theme options
2926	1354334560063	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard i've ever used.
2927	1354334560063	5	lensixteen ratingfive it predicts words wonderfully and makes typing a lot more intuitive than on my stock keyboard.
2928	1354334560063	5	leneleven ratingfive you can seriously type gibberish and this will get it right.
2929	1354332423105	4	leneleven ratingfour after my galaxy nexus got updated to 4.2, the keyboard was gone.
2930	1354332423105	4	lennine ratingfour not just gone as default keyboard, but removed uninstalled.
2931	1354332423105	4	leneight ratingfour strange, no one else is seeing this issue.
2932	1354332423105	4	lennine ratingfour nevertheless the stars for its great word prediction feature
2933	1354326290769	2	leneight ratingtwo dear friends this application is not for us.
2934	1354326290769	2	lentwelve ratingtwo i have downloaded by mistake and now i am not using it.
2935	1354326290769	2	lennineteen ratingtwo the basic s-pen function is not there and you have to revert back to the basic android application.
2936	1354326290769	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo otherwise in regards to function it is same as android sans themes and colours.
2937	1354325345626	5	leneight ratingfive there is nothing that really compares to swiftkey.
2938	1354325345626	5	lenten ratingfive it is super responsive and fairly accurate with its prefiticitons.
2939	1354325345626	5	leneleven ratingfive highly recommended this application if you're searching for an alternative.
2940	1354325345626	5	lenthree ratingfive definitely worth it!
2941	1354323638836	5	lenfourteen ratingfive only problem i have now is that i reply super fast to text lol.
2942	1354323638836	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this app.
2943	1354320564314	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i commonly have the problem that it will not do predictions in landscape mode.
2944	1354320564314	5	lenseven ratingfive i have to switch back to portrait.
2945	1354320564314	5	lensix ratingfive need a button to toggle predictions.
2946	1354319943370	3	lennine ratingthree when i first purchased this keyboard, i loved it.
2947	1354319943370	3	lenseventeen ratingthree now it's just like any other keyboard, not keeping my regularly used terms in its dictionary.
2948	1354319943370	3	lennine ratingthree i've uninstalled it and reinstalled to no avail.
2949	1354319943370	3	leneight ratingthree i'd like to enjoy this keyboard again.
2950	1354319624142	5	lenfour ratingfive no uso ning¨²n otro teclado.
2951	1354319624142	5	lenthree ratingfive es el mejor.
2952	1354319624142	5	lenfive ratingfive el m¨¢s r¨¢pido y con una predicci¨®n estupenda.
2953	1354319624142	5	leneighteen ratingfive lo que m¨¢s me gusta es poder usar tres idiomas al mismo tiempo que en mi caso es importante.
2954	1354317811361	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard app on the market.
2955	1354313554476	5	lentwenty ratingfive i have use this for awhile and have not been disapointed, im currently installing it to my asus transformer prime
2956	1354312552281	4	lenthree ratingfour version 2 was amazing.
2957	1354312552281	4	leneleven ratingfour i could touch type and it would know what i meant.
2958	1354312552281	4	lenthree ratingfour version 3 lost this.
2959	1354312552281	4	lentwenty ratingfour it's lacking customisation to make it efficient enough to compete with swype which makes touch typing feel like swimming.
2960	1354308825274	5	leneight ratingfive love personalization on my phone and it fits
2961	1354303327144	1	lennineteen ratingone the auto correction is totally busted(makes you write like a retard) the setup is overly complicated and confusing.
2962	1354298921103	5	lenten ratingfive specially when i go up to 5 words without typing anything :)
2963	1354433485173	5	lentwo ratingfive otherwise, perfect!
2964	1354433485173	5	lensix ratingfive looking forward to trying swiftkey flow!
2965	1354433485173	5	lenseventeen ratingfive bug: when typing words beginning with a capital letter on firefox, that word won't be written
2966	1354432818970	1	lensix ratingone gets hang a lot of time.
2967	1354432818970	1	lensix ratingone provide an update for the issue.
2968	1354432818970	1	lenfive ratingone and plz provide new themes.
2969	1354432198840	3	lentwelve ratingthree auto correct and predictions only work on few apps for jelly bean.
2970	1354432198840	3	lennine ratingthree can't even get it for the default browser.
2971	1354432070412	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour i would've gave it 5 stars but i can't. sometimes the auto predict won't even come up when you're texting/typing.
2972	1354431447874	5	leneight ratingfive would definitely use the free trial before purchasing.
2973	1354431447874	5	lenfour ratingfive recommend to all s3 users!
2974	1354430979727	4	leneight ratingfour very good keyboard, even better than ics keyboard.
2975	1354430979727	4	lentwentyseven ratingfour some of the minor problems i have with it are the fact that the keyboard wants to insert an i if you hit enter after a period.
2976	1354430979727	4	lensixtytwo ratingfour i like the fact that it can predict my words but i rarely start a sentence with i. also some of the words it will allow me to type and won't correct are some of the most mispelled words, although there are only a handful and the keyboard will learn which words you use and don't. overall very good keyboard.
2977	1354429209221	3	lenthirteen ratingthree i love this keyboard, but since updating to 4.2.1, i've got performance issues.
2978	1354429209221	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree first, the keyboard takes too long to show up  second, the keyboard lags when typing rapidly (it used to be buttery smooth).
2979	1354428023046	5	lennine ratingfive had the free version loaded for about a month.
2980	1354428023046	5	lenseven ratingfive it only made my typing more efficient.
2981	1354428023046	5	lentwentyone ratingfive they have stats in the app to illustrate the improvement - but it's not too hard to see on your own.
2982	1354428023046	5	leneight ratingfive all the app really lacks is more themes.
2983	1354428023046	5	leneight ratingfive but it does it's job freakishly well.
2984	1354428023046	5	lenfour ratingfive well worth the keesh.
2985	1354424513942	5	lennineteen ratingfive after getting the gsiii i was a little bit unhappy with the stock samsung keyboard and predictive text capabilities.
2986	1354424513942	5	lentwelve ratingfive without a doubt this new swiftkey keyboard met and exceeded my requirements.
2987	1354424513942	5	lensix ratingfive more efficient and saved me "4000 keystrokes"
2988	1354424513942	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i will highly recommend it to anyone with a new phone and/or clumsy fingers.
2989	1354424513942	5	lenfifteen ratingfive plus the endless personalization, themes, and colors put it over the top in my mind.
2990	1354424062845	1	lentwelve ratingone would have been great to receive the incompatibility warning prior to paying.
2991	1354424062845	1	lenseven ratingone really crappy job thinking about the user.
2992	1354423401351	2	lennine ratingtwo the auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous.
2993	1354423401351	2	lenseven ratingtwo allow the option to turn it off.
2994	1354423401351	2	lentwentytwo ratingtwo this is one of the highest (3rd) rated suggestions on your feedback/feature requests website and has been for well over a year.
2995	1354423401351	2	lennine ratingtwo instead you seem more interested in creating more themes.
2996	1354423401351	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo when this gets implemented, i'd be more then happy to give 5 stars.
2997	1354420046962	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i just downloaded this app and it's great it has yet to predict the wrong word.
2998	1354420046962	5	lensixteen ratingfive please give it a try and don't be afraid to get creative with your words
2999	1354420026785	5	lenfiftyseven ratingfive i have been using this app for a few days, writing this review with it, and it is nice to use very accurate and much better than the original swype keypad, and the best part is i can actually have spaces rather than catching comas all the time, cso i rate this app five stars, and thanks. :)
3000	1354418814811	1	lenseven ratingone why did i pay for this rubbish?
3001	1354418814811	1	leneight ratingone it keeps inserting words i don't want.
3002	1354418814811	1	lentwo ratingone suggests crap.
3003	1354418814811	1	lentwo ratingone limited dictionary.
3004	1354418814811	1	leneighteen ratingone costs me way more effort than the std keyboard because i have to go back constantly to correct.
3005	1354418532550	5	lenfour ratingfive helps me type faster
3006	1354417368910	5	lensix ratingfive htc one x+, love this keyboard.
3007	1354417009481	5	leneighteen ratingfive i was hesitant to buy a keyboard but this thing blows the native keyboard out of the water!
3008	1354417009481	5	lennine ratingfive just gets better the more you use your phone.
3009	1354417009481	5	leneight ratingfive don't hesitate you won't regret it!
3010	1354414193738	5	lenfive ratingfive this app is crazy amazing.
3011	1354414193738	5	lentwelve ratingfive i use it all the time (obviously) and it's really accurate.
3012	1354409814949	5	lenfive ratingfive looking forward to swiftkey flow.
3013	1354408793869	5	lenthree ratingfive definitely worth it
3014	1354408654020	3	lenfourteen ratingthree just little niggles like not working correctly in chrome like user name and captchas.
3015	1354408654020	3	lensix ratingthree emoji support would be awesome please.
3016	1354406166810	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it use to lag like crazy for me, but now it preforms amazing!
3017	1354406166810	5	lennine ratingfive the record for predicting words was 8 in a row!
3018	1354406166810	5	lenthirteen ratingfive at first the predictions were way off, but now they are dead on!
3019	1354406166810	5	lentwo ratingfive amazing keyboard!
3020	1354400782317	5	lenseven ratingfive much better then the stock text input
3021	1354400022415	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour this is an outstanding app and i would give it a 5 rating if they can add: (1) swipe functionality and (2) more keyboard themes.
3022	1354400022415	4	lenten ratingfour the current set of themes lack the look and feel.
3023	1354399520214	3	leneighteen ratingthree good keyboard, portuguese is outdated and dev charges separately for tablet version, still best keyboard on the market.
3024	1354396855067	1	lenfifteen ratingone keeps saying it saved me 10,000 keystroke but it doesnt take into account the 50,000 it missed.
3025	1354396855067	1	leneleven ratingone doesnt even put an apostrophe on the doesnt in this critique.
3026	1354396855067	1	lensix ratingone i miss my iphone spell check.
3027	1354396019522	5	lenfour ratingfive absolutely love this keyboard.
3028	1354396019522	5	lenfive ratingfive wouldn't use anything else!
3029	1354395335505	5	lentwenty ratingfive i got it when i had my htc evo 3d, and now i have the galaxy note 2 and it is awesome!
3030	1354395335505	5	lenseven ratingfive i won't have any other keyboard.
3031	1354394851206	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny.
3032	1354394206234	5	lenthirteen ratingfive the app is great, way better of a keyboard than the ics keyboard.
3033	1354394206234	5	leneleven ratingfive with the latest update the voice recognition is the latest version!
3034	1354394206234	5	lenfour ratingfive app is almost perfect.
3035	1354391161330	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i can't fix typos often when i already have typed other words.
3036	1354391161330	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour i'll go back to fix it and when i press the backspace button, it adds chucks of words instead of erasing.
3037	1354391161330	4	lentwelve ratingfour also, when typing in all capitals, the auto correct is very bad.
3038	1354384698493	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this is a great enhancement over the default samsung app installed in the phone.
3039	1354379604006	5	lentwenty ratingfive easiest keyboard to use and has logical predictions to use and a decent auto correct that will spell words correctly!
3040	1354378734629	4	lentwelve ratingfour this is by far the best third party keyboard on the market.
3041	1354378734629	4	lennineteen ratingfour i was a swyper for a long time, but bugs (and a sale price) had me check out swiftkey.
3042	1354378734629	4	lenfifteen ratingfour rarely has a hiccup, but some keys i'd rather have on the main board.
3043	1354378734629	4	lensix ratingfour otherwise this would be five stars.
3044	1354378685168	5	lenfour ratingfive best keyboard hands down.
3045	1354378685168	5	lenthirteen ratingfive the accuracy and predictions are awesome; they even come up in other languages.
3046	1354378685168	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive speaking of which though, i wish there was japanese and chinese available so i don't have to keep switching keyboards just to type those!
3047	1354377596002	5	lenfour ratingfive please add more themes
3048	1354377138104	5	lenten ratingfive when i got my samsung s3 i basically gave up texting.
3049	1354377138104	5	lenfour ratingfive the keyboard really sucks.
3050	1354377138104	5	leneight ratingfive this app has me back in communication again.
3051	1354377138104	5	lensix ratingfive most of my friends are glad.
3052	1354374237628	5	lenthree ratingfive love this app.
3053	1354374237628	5	leneleven ratingfive it's by far one of the best for android devices.
3054	1354374237628	5	leneleven ratingfive beats the crap out of the go keyboard free bee app
3055	1354371264029	3	lenseventeen ratingthree great app but you lose the ability to add standard samsung characters, like the hearts for example.
3056	1354371264029	3	lenfour ratingthree also no personal dictionary.
3057	1354371264029	3	lentwelve ratingthree with both of these it would be awesome & would then earn 5 stars.
3058	1354370532604	4	lentwentyone ratingfour what about being able to learn from whatsapp as i do most of the typing there (most of the people do).
3059	1354370532604	4	lensix ratingfour we also need italian keyboard layout
3060	1354294892801	5	leneight ratingfive simply the best keyboard on android play store.
3061	1354294892801	5	lensix ratingfive thoroughly deserve every single dollar spent.
3062	1354294892801	5	leneight ratingfive won't be using any keyboard besides this.
3063	1354294181302	5	lenseventeen ratingfive sincerely, i've never thought typing on my phone would be easier than typing on my computer.
3064	1354294181302	5	lenfive ratingfive this app changed my mind.
3065	1354294181302	5	lenseventeen ratingfive sometimes, it simply amazes you how it corrects every typo, and how it predicts your whole sentence.
3066	1354294181302	5	lennine ratingfive i'm faster than my blackberry friends at messaging!
3067	1354294181302	5	leneight ratingfive and i wrote all this in about 30 secs.
3068	1354292874367	4	lenten ratingfour please add a vibrate setting like the stock android keyboard.
3069	1354291312177	4	lenthirtyone ratingfour i have noticed that the standard samsung keyboard method will come back every now and then and i have to swipe to get the notification center and change back to "swiftkey 3"
3070	1354291312177	4	lenthree ratingfour from "samsung keyboard"
3071	1354291312177	4	lenseventeen ratingfour it will happen every time i restart the phone and then try to text or anything else.
3072	1354288822946	5	lentwelve ratingfive for whatever reason, the native keyboard app on the galaxy s3 is awful.
3073	1354288822946	5	lensix ratingfive so happy i found this app.
3074	1354288822946	5	lenseven ratingfive it makes my user experience way better.
3075	1354288794277	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive i love the occasional messages saying you have saved ten thousand keystrokes (or however many) think of all the time i could have wasted typing them in!
3076	1354288794277	5	leneighteen ratingfive also great feature having the auto space after chosen word, hubbies htc keyboard doesn't have that soiendupwritingonereallylongword!
3077	1354288794277	5	lentwo ratingfive (galaxy ace 2)
3078	1354288388991	5	lenthirteen ratingfive you really dont know what you are missing if you dont try it.
3079	1354288388991	5	lensixteen ratingfive over the last 3 years i've tried many phones but swift keyboard just works like charm.
3080	1354288388991	5	lensix ratingfive better than all the stock keyboards.
3081	1354288388991	5	lennineteen ratingfive trust me give it a try and you wont allow yourself to get back to the old stock keyboard.
3082	1354288388991	5	lentwentythree ratingfive and finally i cant explain how accurate the word predictions are as in you and your phone share some sort of telepathy powers.
3083	1354288388991	5	lenfive ratingfive beggars belief try it now.
3084	1354285473121	4	lenfifteen ratingfour the only thing stopping this keyboard being the perfect android keyboard are these two issues.
3085	1354285473121	4	lensix ratingfour issue 1: i don't use smileys!
3086	1354285473121	4	lentwenty ratingfour please give me the option to have a persistent enter key, instead of the smiley key forced by some apps.
3087	1354285473121	4	lenfour ratingfour issue 2: alt keys layout.
3088	1354285473121	4	lenfourteen ratingfour couldn't you just set it out like every other keyboard on the market!?
3089	1354285473121	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour i want my numbers where they are shown on the main screen,  i want my alt keys where they are shown on the main screen.
3090	1354285473121	4	leneight ratingfour at least give the option to your users.
3091	1354283456716	5	leneight ratingfive i better be able to upgrade for free.
3092	1354283456716	5	lenfive ratingfive i love this keyboard though.
3093	1354283114606	4	lenfour ratingfour i love this app.
3094	1354283114606	4	leneleven ratingfour i use it on my samsung galaxy s3 on android 4.1.1 jelly bean.
3095	1354283114606	4	leneleven ratingfour the only complaint i do have are a couple of bugs.
3096	1354283114606	4	lentwentyeight ratingfour on occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
3097	1354283114606	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to facebook.
3098	1354283114606	4	lenten ratingfour it renders it useless anytime i see something facebook worthy.
3099	1354283114606	4	lentwelve ratingfour i will give this app five stars when these things are fixed.
3100	1354281052331	5	lenten ratingfive the predictive text of my built in samsung was appalling.
3101	1354281052331	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this works a million times better and doesn't get in the way.
3102	1354281052331	5	lenseventeen ratingfive you can get 90% there intuitively at which point it's worth training yourself to use it accurately.
3103	1354234822380	4	lentwentyeight ratingfour it's an amazing keyboard except that if you misspell a word and it underlines it, and you select the proper word it doesn't actually change it.
3104	1354234822380	4	leneight ratingfour it just puts the cursor at that location.
3105	1354234822380	4	lenseven ratingfour other than that it's effing amazing.
3106	1354234626506	5	lensixteen ratingfive this is literally the only app i've rated after owning android phones for four years.
3107	1354234381666	5	lenseven ratingfive thanks for finally adding my particular dialect!
3108	1354234381666	5	leneleven ratingfive i previously had to make do with the queen's english.
3109	1354234050200	3	lenthirteen ratingthree when ever i enter my email address the auto space messes shot up.
3110	1354234050200	3	leneighteen ratingthree lack of hand writing support for the note 2 is a shame, will inable again when this is supported.
3111	1354234050200	3	lennine ratingthree loved swiftkey3 on my evo hate it on the note
3112	1354231528124	5	lenten ratingfive this app is so much better than the onboard keyboard.
3113	1354231528124	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i make typos like crazy and it almost made me miss my iphone but this app has made everything so much better.
3114	1354231037433	5	lentwenty ratingfive i love the galaxy s3, but i hate the samsung g keyboard and how it will not auto correct for you.
3115	1354231037433	5	lennine ratingfive all my problems have been solved with the swiftkey.
3116	1354231037433	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it fits in so well with the phone, and works like a charm.
3117	1354228438380	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive i love this app, but i would love it even more if you could turn off those silly android emoticons and if the numbers on the numbers page were at the top in a row.
3118	1354227632661	5	leneight ratingfive getting praise from me is hard only the.
3119	1354227632661	5	lennine ratingfive second time i've ever done a public comment.
3120	1354227632661	5	leneight ratingfive but this keyboard is so accurate and word.
3121	1354227632661	5	lenfive ratingfive prediction os freaky scary accurate.
3122	1354226996724	4	lenseven ratingfour would like standard/more keyboard sound(s)
3123	1354226255564	5	lenfour ratingfive best keyboard ever created!
3124	1354226255564	5	lenfourteen ratingfive highly recommend to anyone who wants to make typing on their phones easy & fast.
3125	1354225387863	4	leneight ratingfour love this keyboard, provides accurate and efficient typing.
3126	1354225387863	4	lenfive ratingfour the predictions are quite impressive.
3127	1354225387863	4	lensix ratingfour more customisable themes would be excellent.
3128	1354225387863	4	leneleven ratingfour a nice dark black theme, or deep purple would be nice.
3129	1354225387863	4	lenten ratingfour the ability to customize your colours would be sweet too.
3130	1354225387863	4	leneight ratingfour other than that the keyboard is very sweet.
3131	1354220705622	4	lentwentynine ratingfour this is a great app even if now there is the new android 4.2 but to get 5 stars it has to have swipe like in the new version of android!
3132	1354218525465	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this keyboard.
3133	1354218525465	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it is incredibly accurate with fixing any mistyped and the predictions are amazing.
3134	1354218525465	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i only wish there was an option to disable the instant space after a punctuation.
3135	1354218525465	5	lentwenty ratingfive i constantly hit the space bar after inserting a period which adds a word that i didn't want there.
3136	1354218052563	5	lenfourteen ratingfive its a great app but recently just realized that it does drain my battery
3137	1354217886455	5	leneight ratingfive sometimes it feels like it reads my mind.
3138	1354216547134	1	lennine ratingone prediction bar disappears when turning screen on and off.
3139	1354216547134	1	lenfour ratingone this issue is 100% reproducible.
3140	1354216547134	1	lensix ratingone will update review rating once fixed.
3141	1354214772598	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive great app, this is the only app i've ever paid for,saves so much time, highly recommended, especially to quick or lazy typists.
3142	1354213940206	1	leneight ratingone i purchased this app a long time ago.
3143	1354213940206	1	lenfourteen ratingone typing was really fast, predictions were good, way better than the stock keyboard(s).
3144	1354213940206	1	lentwelve ratingone but since ics and also with jelly bean typing is near impossible.
3145	1354213940206	1	lenfive ratingone the whole application just halts.
3146	1354213940206	1	leneight ratingone keypresses are piled up and released at once.
3147	1354213940206	1	lenfive ratingone this leads to "long presses"
3148	1354213940206	1	leneleven ratingone and i get all kind of funky chars in my texts.
3149	1354213940206	1	lenfourteen ratingone it's no issue with my roms as i've tried like 10 different versions.
3150	1354213940206	1	lentwelve ratingone ram and cpu are good, nothing else is running, no improvements possible.
3151	1354213940206	1	leneight ratingone just have a look at the bug section.
3152	1354213940206	1	lenthree ratingone search for "lag".
3153	1354213370657	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this app!
3154	1354211367100	3	lenfifteen ratingthree the best predictions of any keyboard i've ever used but very lacking in customization.
3155	1354211367100	3	lennine ratingthree take a page from perfect keyboard and fix that.
3156	1354211367100	3	lenthirtytwo ratingthree like the character popup, it annoys me personally and runs slow on my phone anyway, so i'd actually like to turn it off because i make more mistakes with it on.
3157	1354211367100	3	leneight ratingthree and the number /symbols pad drives me nuts.
3158	1354211367100	3	lennine ratingthree offering more alternate layouts for that would be nice.
3159	1354211367100	3	lenseventeen ratingthree also a set of arrows to pad through our characters would be nice because finger insertion sucks.
3160	1354208234636	5	leneight ratingfive this is the best keyboard i've used.
3161	1354208234636	5	leneleven ratingfive the predictive text is great and becomes more and more intuitive.
3162	1354208234636	5	lenfifteen ratingfive you can turn on learning from facebook status updates, twitter updates, and sms message writing.
3163	1354208234636	5	lenfive ratingfive and the spacebar is wider!
3164	1354208234636	5	lennine ratingfive no longer am i placing periods after every word!
3165	1354208234636	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommend.
3166	1354207844917	5	leneleven ratingfive i have definitely been typing faster since i switched to swiftkey.
3167	1354207844917	5	lenthirtyfour ratingfive the predictions are really good, and even though it takes a bit of a learning curve to use, there is no way you will want to go back once you get used to it.
3168	1354207844917	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny.
3169	1354207681301	5	leneleven ratingfive best keyboard on the market, looking forward to getting swiftkey flow!
3170	1354207354259	2	leneight ratingtwo i want to like this, really i do.
3171	1354207354259	2	lenfortysix ratingtwo but between it shoving words after commas without me noticing, overly aggressive spell check and if i let it type out a sentance by just hitting space bar a lot it types out my cover letter for a job i applied for over a year ago.
3172	1354207354259	2	lenthirty ratingtwo since i've purchased this a year ago i've given it a try 3 times and have always had to stop after a couple of weeks just out of frustration.
3173	1354206825860	5	lensix ratingfive galaxy s 3 -  i love this keyboard.
3174	1354206825860	5	lenthree ratingfive predictions are awsome.
3175	1354206825860	5	lenseventeen ratingfive never thought i will get use to a touch screen phone but this keyboard is just awsome.
3176	1354206825860	5	lenthirteen ratingfive once the trial version is over you are gonna want to get it.
3177	1354206825860	5	lenfour ratingfive again i love itttt.
3178	1354206442236	3	lentwelve ratingthree this keyboard has the best prediction of any that i've tried.
3179	1354206442236	3	lenten ratingthree unfortunately, it is laggy to appear and respond to input.
3180	1354206442236	3	lenfifteen ratingthree it also has poor app compatibility: it basically doesn't work in firefox or sygic.
3181	1354206442236	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree if they could slim it down, make it snappier and improve it's compatibility it would be the best android keyboard available.
3182	1354206442236	3	leneight ratingthree right now it's alternately awesome and infuriating.
3183	1354205960697	5	leneightytwo ratingfive i had this app for a year now i go it in 2011 for .10 cents i bought it only because it was ten cents and i never ever used it till i got a new phone and figured i'd try it out i really wish i would of used it than because this keyboard blows away the stock one and swypes keyboard (i do like swype also almost just as much) but this is one keyboard i can not be without now!
3184	1354205960697	5	lentwelve ratingfive i was hooked in this after the first few words i type!
3185	1354203071220	1	lennineteen ratingone two letters aren't working on my keyboard c and v. why did i pay for this app.ugh
3186	1354203027013	4	lentwentyone ratingfour if it changes my word and i hit the backspace key it should automatically keep the word i typed please fix!
3187	1354202870157	5	leneleven ratingfive this keyboard learns words and your habits at an amazing rate.
3188	1354202870157	5	lenthirteen ratingfive predictions are far better than the standard ones that come on android phones.
3189	1354202870157	5	lenfourteen ratingfive the only app i've ever paid for and it was well worth it.
3190	1354201832248	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i have an s3 and the default keypad was not that great on that.
3191	1354201832248	5	lentwelve ratingfive this however is a vast improvement and i love it so much.
3192	1354201832248	5	lenfour ratingfive themes for the keyboard.
3193	1354201832248	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive so its not the same old bland one also i like how double tap space leaves a full stop where as before it never did.
3194	1354201832248	5	lenfive ratingfive great app really do recommend.
3195	1354195301363	4	lenthirtyfive ratingfour this is a really nice keyboard and has allowed me to increase my speed a lot due to its great error corrections, but it is lacking in that it doesn't allow you to swipe.
3196	1354195301363	4	lensixteen ratingfour if you could swipe to type too, i could increase my one handed typing speed significantly.
3197	1354139126248	5	lensix ratingfive i'd be lost without swiftkey.
3198	1354138766460	4	lenseven ratingfour everything about the app is pretty good.
3199	1354138766460	4	lennine ratingfour there are just 3 things i would want for improvement.
3200	1354138766460	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i wish the app showed you a personal dictionary of the words it "learns"
3201	1354138766460	4	lenfour ratingfour somehow incorporate swype (t9 trace).
3202	1354138766460	4	lennineteen ratingfour move the 10 key number pad to the middle instead of all the way to the left of the keyboard.
3203	1354138766460	4	lenseven ratingfour other than that, this app is fantastic.
3204	1354137486287	1	lentwelve ratingone i really can't understand why this has good ratings its rubbish
3205	1354137429874	2	lenseven ratingtwo too slow, i'll stick to anysoftkeyboard
3206	1354136724033	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this should be the official android app, best keyboard ever - worth the price!
3207	1354134747794	5	lensixteen ratingfive i love this keyboard, have tried all the others i keep coming back to this one.
3208	1354129831765	5	lenseven ratingfive the most efficient typing application out there.
3209	1354129831765	5	lensix ratingfive love the predictions and auto-corrections.
3210	1354129831765	5	lenfive ratingfive typing is a breeze now.
3211	1354129831765	5	lenfour ratingfive totally worth the price.
3212	1354129831765	5	lensix ratingfive hope it supports chinese input soon.
3213	1354128975063	3	lenfive ratingthree been using this since gingerbread.
3214	1354128975063	3	lensix ratingthree worked great with that and ics.
3215	1354128975063	3	lenfive ratingthree on jellybean now on note 2.
3216	1354128975063	3	lensixteen ratingthree very slow to backspace through words and randomly won't display autocorrect suggestions or correct anything.
3217	1354128975063	3	lentwelve ratingthree have to close keyboard and reopen to get suggestions way too often.
3218	1354128975063	3	lentwenty ratingthree still waiting for a fix before switching back to stock or using smart keyboard, etc.   great when it worked though!
3219	1354128401600	5	leneleven ratingfive this keyboard is east to use and makes typing very fast
3220	1354128154733	5	lenfive ratingfive i love using this keyboard!
3221	1354126499610	1	lentwenty ratingone i just purchase this and it wont install that really sucks .do something or give me my money back seriously
3222	1354125606871	4	lennine ratingfour accurate text predictions, best i've used so far.
3223	1354125606871	4	lensix ratingfour too few themes, most are ugly.
3224	1354125606871	4	lenfour ratingfour please add more themes.
3225	1354125606871	4	lenfour ratingfour please add more themes.
3226	1354124664448	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this is literally the best keyboard i have ever used it is freakishly accurate.
3227	1354124664448	5	lentwenty ratingfive i wish i had known about this sooner it would have saved a lot of time editing all my emails.
3228	1354124664448	5	lennineteen ratingfive i think it's a must have if you text or type a lot of emails on your phone.
3229	1354123216553	5	lenfour ratingfive i loved this keyboard!
3230	1354123216553	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i can type without putting space between the words, and it does all the work.
3231	1354123216553	5	lentwelve ratingfive in addition, i can have another language running at the same time.
3232	1354123216553	5	leneleven ratingfive also, themes are really cool, the typos correction is just amazing.
3233	1354123216553	5	lenfive ratingfive back without holding any key.
3234	1354122967344	5	lenfour ratingfive this app is great.
3235	1354122967344	5	lenthirtyfour ratingfive the stock keyboard doesn't come close compared to this, i like the way it learns as you type making texting quicker because the words are there just to be pressed rather than typed.
3236	1354122886672	4	lenfive ratingfour signed up for the beta.
3237	1354122145659	5	lentwo ratingfive nice app.
3238	1354122145659	5	lenfive ratingfive makes it easy to type
3239	1354122135547	1	lenthirteen ratingone has been brilliant but something has caused the language packs not to download!
3240	1354122135547	1	leneleven ratingone dont know what but until ita fixed i cant use it.
3241	1354122135547	1	lenseven ratingone ill change to 5 stars when it is.
3242	1354121443594	3	lenfortyone ratingthree great app, esp has i'm dyslexic it helped me greatly, that i bought the app from the trial, it worked fine for a few days, just it became buggy, not sure what happened lost the pre-text and other features.
3243	1354121443594	3	lenthirtythree ratingthree it started to become unresponsive until it begun to type with errors etc.  i've tried to download again,it says its installed, but it don't seem to be reaching my phone.
3244	1354121443594	3	lentwentyfive ratingthree like i've said i've looked all in my phone through all my apps everywhere but it appears to have gone from my phone.
3245	1354121443594	3	lensixteen ratingthree could you resend it or mail or contact me on how to get it working again?
3246	1354120230570	5	lenseventeen ratingfive but the android 4.2 keyboard does it all on both tablet and phone with swipe feature built in.
3247	1354120230570	5	leneight ratingfive i used to switch between swype and swiftkey.
3248	1354120230570	5	lenfourteen ratingfive and you have to buy a tablet version of swift separate from the phone.
3249	1354120230570	5	leneight ratingfive now i use one keyboard on both devices.
3250	1354120222876	5	lensixteen ratingfive never really buy apps but the reviews i have heard on this forced me into it.
3251	1354120222876	5	lenthree ratingfive wow so impressive!
3252	1354120222876	5	lentwelve ratingfive i i'm dyslexic and this makes life so quick and easy
3253	1354118668962	5	lenthirteen ratingfive need for themes!such as iphone theme and windows phone theme!more themes
3254	1354117139154	4	lensixteen ratingfour been using this keyboard for quite some time on both samsung galaxy s and galaxy note 2.
3255	1354117139154	4	lenthree ratingfour great learning capabilities.
3256	1354117139154	4	lenthree ratingfour great auto correct.
3257	1354117139154	4	lensix ratingfour i wish it has emoticons though
3258	1354116754055	5	lensix ratingfive i swear by swiftkey since beta.
3259	1354116754055	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i've tried a number of others, but always seem to come back to swiftkey.
3260	1354116754055	5	lenfive ratingfive it's prediction is amazing.
3261	1354116754055	5	lentwentynine ratingfive the keyboard and the various themes make it quite comfortable to type, either in portrait or landscape, also learning your typing style the more you use it works well.
3262	1354116754055	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommended!
3263	1354116754055	5	lentwenty ratingfive (i wrote this review, because i do really love swiftkey. plus, i wanted to see my review post to google+)
3264	1354116126346	5	lentwo ratingfive great app
3265	1354115836304	4	lenseven ratingfour i've thus far loved this keyboard.
3266	1354115836304	4	lennine ratingfour from the great easy setup to the great predictions.
3267	1354115836304	4	leneight ratingfour but on my thunderbolt multi touch has issues.
3268	1354114493050	5	lentwelve ratingfive el que trae el galaxy s3 no es muy bueno, este se paso.
3269	1354114493050	5	lenfourteen ratingfive mejor que todo lo que he usado antes, mejor que bb y que ios.
3270	1354114088420	5	lenseven ratingfive my go to keyboard app on android.
3271	1354110592465	5	lensix ratingfive excellent keyboard nice ui and ia
3272	1354109718678	5	lenfive ratingfive s3 keyboard was driving me bananas.
3273	1354109718678	5	leneight ratingfive do yourself a favor and get this app.
3274	1354108591954	5	leneleven ratingfive i love this keyboard because it predicts the words very helpful.
3275	1354108591954	5	leneight ratingfive thank you guys keep up the good work!
3276	1354075400765	5	lenfive ratingfive love the new themes too!
3277	1354075400765	5	lenseven ratingfive hopefully more themes are on their way!
3278	1354075400765	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i had it for a really long time from the amazon market but i bought it here because it updates faster!
3279	1354075400765	5	leneighteen ratingfive since i update my t-mobile samsung galaxy s3 to jelly bean 4.1.1 it keeps going back to stock keyboard!
3280	1354073332688	5	lenfifteen ratingfive it's a very good application but it support traditional chinese language will be perfect.
3281	1354068682206	5	lensix ratingfive saves me time and is accurate.
3282	1354066724292	5	lensix ratingfive easily the best keyboard for android.
3283	1354066724292	5	lenthree ratingfive incredible word prediction.
3284	1354066724292	5	lensix ratingfive saved many 1000's of key strokes
3285	1354066501336	4	lenfifteen ratingfour only problem is i find the shift key is to close to the "a" key.
3286	1354066501336	4	lentwelve ratingfour i have fat fingers and i always press shift rather than "a."
3287	1354066501336	4	lenten ratingfour otherwise it's one of the best keywords out there.
3288	1354065805333	1	lenfourteen ratingone after the update to android 4.0.2 swift key was gone, status purchased but not installed!?
3289	1354065028345	5	lennine ratingfive the absolutely best testing app i've ever seen.
3290	1354063795199	5	lenten ratingfive i can't believe i haven't reviewed this yet.
3291	1354063762356	5	lentwenty ratingfive i'm using the trial keyboard, but can't miss the sale off :), buy it and waiting for vietnamese language.
3292	1354063453765	5	lenfifteen ratingfive based on my experiences, swiftkey is the best android keyboard that i have ever tried.
3293	1354063453765	5	lentwentythree ratingfive it has a great layout and it has the most intelligent word prediction it can handle up to 3 languages at the same time.
3294	1354063453765	5	lenseventeen ratingfive it also learn from the way i type based on my gmail and my twitter post :) amazing :)
3295	1354062473589	4	lenten ratingfour still not perfect but the best out there by miles.
3296	1354058066463	5	lensixteen ratingfive an excellent keyboard, i bought this while it was on offer and have never looked back!
3297	1354058066463	5	leneighteen ratingfive i never saw the importance of having a different keyboard until i used this for the first time!
3298	1354058066463	5	leneleven ratingfive i would pay double for this now as it is invaluable!
3299	1354057433957	5	lenthirtyfour ratingfive when the new jelly bean update came out i ditched thisand tried out google's attempt but now i've re installed what i think is this best and most accurate keyboard out there
3300	1354056444038	4	lensixteen ratingfour just need to be able to drop the keyboard once your finished otherwise really good app
3301	1354055781740	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard
3302	1354055720371	5	lenfive ratingfive this is an amazing app.
3303	1354055720371	5	lennineteen ratingfive the predictions are great and it correct everything even if what you typed is way off the actual word.
3304	1354055720371	5	lentwenty ratingfive the skins look great and the app learns everything about how you type and the words you input the most.
3305	1354055720371	5	lenten ratingfive overall this is the best keyboard app on the market.
3306	1354055720371	5	lenfour ratingfive absolutely worth the price.
3307	1354052392786	2	leneleven ratingtwo i upgraded my htc sensation 4g on t mobile & now swiftkey sucks.
3308	1354052392786	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo gets stuck on entries, hold up, delay while typing, doesn't correctly read my tapping.
3309	1354051622995	4	lenseven ratingfour i just wish there were more themes.
3310	1354051622995	4	lenseventeen ratingfour i would like one that is the style of the light theme but in a darker color
3311	1354050383629	5	lensix ratingfive i love the neon blue layout!
3312	1354049384980	5	lenseventeen ratingfive used to think swipe typing was the fastest but the prediction on this keyboard is a revelation.
3313	1354049384980	5	lennine ratingfive makes one hand or two hand typing really fast.
3314	1354049384980	5	lenthree ratingfive worth the price.
3315	1354049384980	5	lenfourteen ratingfive even google's new keyboard in 4.2 with real time prediction doesn't match this.
3316	1354048154826	5	lenfive ratingfive this is a wonderful keyboard.
3317	1354048154826	5	lentwelve ratingfive i couldn't use anything else now that i have tried it.
3318	1354047007295	4	lentwenty ratingfour the keyboard is ridiculously smart and useful, but the lack of a variety of skins makes it dull after awhile.
3319	1354047007295	4	leneighteen ratingfour i even switch to my stock keyboard once in awhile just to get a different skin while typing.
3320	1354046904763	5	lenten ratingfive this is the best keyboard for your phone out there.
3321	1354046904763	5	lentwelve ratingfive pros:  -predictions are very accurate  -the more you use it the more.
3322	1354046904763	5	lentwenty ratingfive accurate it gets -has some nice looking themes  cons: -not much to say, except it lacks support for mandarin language.
3323	1354046886425	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i haven't used a different keyboard since i bought this one, just because it's amazing.
3324	1354046886425	5	lenten ratingfive like my title says, the auto correct is near perfect.
3325	1354046886425	5	lenseven ratingfive one thing though, it always corrects "texting"
3326	1354046886425	5	lenseven ratingfive is texting not a word or something?
3327	1354046513659	5	lenfourteen ratingfive never thought i would like a keyboard better than swype but now i do.
3328	1354044259684	5	lenthirteen ratingfive but please i would like to disable the pop up letters when typing.
3329	1354044259684	5	lenfive ratingfive like before in some themes.
3330	1354044042759	2	lentwentytwo ratingtwo i am constantly getting a pop up from swift key telling me to select input method even though it's already selected.
3331	1354044042759	2	lenfour ratingtwo would be 5 stars otherwise.
3332	1354043970641	5	lenthirtysix ratingfive in less than a month, my brand new touchscreen-only phone (samsung galaxy s3) was beginning to turn me into a non-texter with all the constant typos and incorrect word predictions from the built in keyboard.
3333	1354043970641	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive so sad :( it was easier just not to send the msg at all.  (the physical keyboard on my old crappy phone was hard to let go of).
3334	1354043970641	5	lentwelve ratingfive one day with swiftkey and i'm texting at lightning speed again!
3335	1354043970641	5	lenfifteen ratingfive using both thumbs etc. 5-stars bc i know they're coming out w a "swype"
3336	1354043970641	5	lentwo ratingfive function soon.
3337	1354042958346	5	lenten ratingfive this is one of the must have apps on android.
3338	1354042958346	5	lennine ratingfive it makes typing on a touch screen much faster.
3339	1354042505673	5	lenfive ratingfive this keyboard is simply amazing!
3340	1354042505673	5	lenseven ratingfive best purchase i've made so far!
3341	1354040750731	5	lentwentynine ratingfive i think it's very smart that you guys decided to make it as an update for those who have already purchased instead of making us buy it again.
3342	1354040750731	5	lenthirteen ratingfive on another note i didn't think this keyboard could get any better!
3343	1354039602322	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this is the only keyboard app anyone will require in an android device!
3344	1354039602322	5	lenthirteen ratingfive the predictions are awesome and it even picks up personal quirks in writing!
3345	1354039396355	5	lenseventeen ratingfive been on swiftkey for over a year now, it is responsive and the prediction engine is excellent.
3346	1354039396355	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i especially love the num pad, much more intuitive than a row of numbers.
3347	1354039396355	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i even tried the latest stock android 4.2 keyboard (which has swipe like feature) and am very sure i can type faster on swiftkey.
3348	1354038546624	4	lenfive ratingfour having stability issues after 4.2 update.
3349	1354037950830	5	leneight ratingfive have been using this daily with no problems.
3350	1354037950830	5	lenseven ratingfive best value app i have ever bought.
3351	1354036647051	5	lenten ratingfive a lot better than built in keyboard and more accurate.
3352	1354036647051	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this will continue to be my keyboard of choice on all future devices
3353	1354034124599	4	lenforty ratingfour apart from a couple of glitches in certain apps where the prediction bar disappears if the screen times out while the keyboard is up, which can be fixed by minimizing the keyboard and opening it back up, it's brilliant.
3354	1354034124599	4	leneleven ratingfour i'm looking forward to the next major update with flow.
3355	1354034124599	4	lenfourteen ratingfour it'll be the best of both worlds; swype like input with swiftkey predictions.
3356	1354033988586	5	leneight ratingfive i stuck with the samsung keyboard for 6 months.
3357	1354033988586	5	lennine ratingfive hated it but i thought what could be better?
3358	1354033988586	5	lenfourteen ratingfive loaded the trial on my samsung note and bought the full app within 15 minutes.
3359	1354033988586	5	lenfour ratingfive swiftkey is absolutely brilliant.
3360	1354033446209	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this is so much better than the stock keyboard, better than go keyboard.
3361	1354033446209	5	lenseven ratingfive the predictions are a huge time-saver.
3362	1354033446209	5	leneleven ratingfive i rarely pay for apps, but i just bought this one.
3363	1354032195668	5	lensix ratingfive much better that the stock keyboard.
3364	1354032195668	5	lenfive ratingfive predictive text works really well.
3365	1354032195668	5	lennine ratingfive it can predict text for you or offer suggestions.
3366	1354032195668	5	lenseven ratingfive a few more themes would be nice.
3367	1354031589914	4	leneight ratingfour on occasion tends to be a bit slow.
3368	1354031101556	5	lenfour ratingfive this app is great.
3369	1354031101556	5	lenfour ratingfive definitely worth the purchase!
3370	1354030842476	3	lensix ratingthree everyone said this app was awesome.
3371	1354030842476	3	lennineteen ratingthree that the keyboard would blow me out of the water and make my babies smell like roses or something.
3372	1354030842476	3	lenfive ratingthree swiftkey is just another keyboard.
3373	1354030842476	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree in fact, the lack of the groovy swype feature that comes stock with the galaxy s3 makes it kind of lame in comparison.
3374	1354030842476	3	lensixteen ratingthree i bought it because it was on sale and i figured i'd try it out.
3375	1354030842476	3	lenfour ratingthree i wasted a dollar.
3376	1354030842476	3	lentwentyone ratingthree i don't know what all the hype is about, but i went back to the stock keyboard within an hour.
3377	1354030842476	3	lenfourteen ratingthree edit: after using it a bit more, it's starting to grow on me.
3378	1354030842476	3	lenfourteen ratingthree once it has the swipe type feature, it will probably become a 4 start product.
3379	1354030270396	4	lenfive ratingfour really good keyboard except the .
3380	1354030270396	4	leneighteen ratingfour com button which makes the space bar too small and ends up with messed up searches in chrome.
3381	1354030270396	4	lenten ratingfour give us an option to get rid of it please.
3382	1354030270396	4	lennine ratingfour who types a full on address these days anyway?
3383	1354030270396	4	lennine ratingfour google normally guesses it before you have written it.
3384	1354030052636	5	lensix ratingfive must have application for your phone.
3385	1354030052636	5	lensix ratingfive just makes typing look so easy!
3386	1354028806769	5	leneight ratingfive keyboard is a vital tool on any smartphone.
3387	1354028806769	5	leneleven ratingfive this app takes the default keyboard to a whole new level.
3388	1354028806769	5	lensixteen ratingfive you will be amazed by how much it adapts and the auto correction tailored to you!
3389	1354028806769	5	lenfifteen ratingfive only thing missing is a clipboard but other than that it fires on all cylinders
3390	1354027996441	5	leneight ratingfive a must have app for your android device.
3391	1354026803102	4	lennineteen ratingfour i used this when i had an htc phone but with a nexus, the stock keyboard still reigns supreme.
3392	1354026803102	4	lentwelve ratingfour one thing i did like about it though was the nice skins.
3393	1354026803102	4	lenthree ratingfour very clean look.
3394	1354026580692	5	leneleven ratingfive very good corrections and suggestions and very clever, well worth getting
3395	1354023558397	4	lenfour ratingfour increased efficiency in typing.
3396	1354022899726	5	lensixteen ratingfive works awesome, can't go back to ios or samsung keyboard ever again after using swiftkey.
3397	1354022899726	5	lensix ratingfive it learns from how you type.
3398	1354022438046	4	lennine ratingfour top app, echt een goede uitbreiding op je telefoon.
3399	1354022438046	4	lenseven ratingfour het leert de woorden uit je smsjes.
3400	1354022438046	4	lentwo ratingfour helemaal top.
3401	1354022263060	5	lenseven ratingfive less typing makes me feel more productive.
3402	1354022263060	5	lentwenty ratingfive it does a good job of predicting the next word which means i don't have to type as much.
3403	1354022145036	5	lenfive ratingfive love this & the tablet version!
3404	1354022145036	5	lenfive ratingfive easy to use & very intuitive.
3405	1354022145036	5	lentwenty ratingfive my only complaint is that every time i restart the phone, it goes back to the default factory samsung keyboard.
3406	1354021976840	3	lenfourteen ratingthree some short words that i add into the dictionary such as "de" or "le"
3407	1354021976840	3	lenseven ratingthree will always automatically become "de" and "le"
3408	1354021976840	3	lenfifteen ratingthree i have to keep converting back to small case manually, which decreased my typing speed.
3409	1353992289316	2	lenten ratingtwo after last update i noticed my phone begin to lag.
3410	1353992289316	2	leneleven ratingtwo lo and behold swiftkey was using 34mb of ram in the background!
3411	1353991537830	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i've had this for a long time because i didn't like the keyboard my phone had and it's awesome
3412	1353991063282	4	lennine ratingfour for those of you asking about the personal dictionary.
3413	1353991063282	4	lensix ratingfour it is built into the app.
3414	1353991063282	4	lenfourteen ratingfour you can delete new word entries by long pressing over the word in question.
3415	1353991063282	4	leneight ratingfour new words are added as you enter them.
3416	1353991063282	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i don't believe that you delete any words in the pre-installed dictionary.
3417	1353989568894	5	lennine ratingfive this is the only app i've ever purchased.
3418	1353988366347	5	leneight ratingfive i am very pleased with the swiftkey keyboard.
3419	1353988366347	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i wasn't sure another keyboard app would make a difference but it certainly has.
3420	1353988366347	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i thought i would try it and see how it works, and am very glad i did.
3421	1353988366347	5	lenten ratingfive almost went back to a phone that has a keyboard.
3422	1353988074206	1	leneight ratingone i had no issues with the free version.
3423	1353988074206	1	leneighteen ratingone but as soon i updated to the pro version, after every reset keyboard goes back to default keyboard.
3424	1353988074206	1	lenfour ratingone need a fix asap.
3425	1353988051707	5	lenthirteen ratingfive previously i used to reserve works that require excessive typing to my laptop.
3426	1353988051707	5	lenfifteen ratingfive but now i prefer my mob and the only reason for it is this app.
3427	1353988051707	5	lenfour ratingfive waiting for swiftkey flow!
3428	1353986042079	5	lensix ratingfive i loath touch screen typing usually.
3429	1353986042079	5	lenthirteen ratingfive but this thing is the best keyboard on android for english at least.
3430	1353986042079	5	lennine ratingfive i wish their were more customizable options for keys.
3431	1353986042079	5	leneight ratingfive i use the question mark much more often.
3432	1353986042079	5	leneight ratingfive i want it to have a dedicated key.
3433	1353984881451	3	lenthirteen ratingthree keyboard locks freezes and/or locks phone up when using firefox or chrome.
3434	1353981102395	5	leneight ratingfive certainly did a good job in the keyboard.
3435	1353981102395	5	leneleven ratingfive my previous keyboard was so lag and kept skipping the backspace.
3436	1353981102395	5	lenseven ratingfive now with swift key, everything is good.
3437	1353980530803	5	lenfive ratingfive i hated the galaxy s3 keyboard!
3438	1353980487150	5	lennine ratingfive this is the only app ive ever bought.ever
3439	1353978361986	5	lennine ratingfive one of the apps i can't live without
3440	1353976481060	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard!
3441	1353976423467	5	lensix ratingfive great keyboard, much better than stock.
3442	1353976029059	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i have only owned it for a short time, but so far so good
3443	1353972213892	5	lenfour ratingfive i lovs this keyboard.
3444	1353972213892	5	lennine ratingfive but it needs emoji can u add a plugin
3445	1353972131157	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i read the review and watched the video and now i'm loving the keyboard.
3446	1353972131157	5	lensix ratingfive i don't regret buying this.
3447	1353971787348	1	leneleven ratingone i purchased the full version w/o trying the free one.
3448	1353971787348	1	lenten ratingone my bad.huge disappointment.want my money back.its useless
3449	1353971497027	5	lennine ratingfive best android keyboard, plus will write gibberish for you.
3450	1353971497027	5	lenseventeen ratingfive thanks again for the next few days ago by the end of this message to your basket.
3451	1353968814345	1	lentwentythree ratingone everytime i turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and i have to keep activating this one.
3452	1353968814345	1	lensix ratingone worked fine until about 3 days ago.
3453	1353967607690	5	lenfive ratingfive the word prediction is crazy.
3454	1353967607690	5	lenfive ratingfive the whole keyboard works great.
3455	1353967607690	5	leneight ratingfive i can't wait for the swipe ability.
3456	1353966698764	5	lenfive ratingfive bought this on my phone.
3457	1353966698764	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive i use this version on my tablet too because it is much better than swiftkey tablet app, which annoys me as i bought the other app too.
3458	1353966698764	5	lenfive ratingfive definitely recommend this app anyway
3459	1353966351293	5	lentwo ratingfive excellent app!
3460	1353966111476	4	leneight ratingfour the beta edition for thai has been expired.
3461	1353966111476	4	leneight ratingfour could you add it to any thai peoples?
3462	1353965582397	5	lenseven ratingfive i can't type without this keyboard.!
3463	1353965582397	5	leneighteen ratingfive but most of the time the punctuation key types a period and i then the one i want.
3464	1353965582397	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive also if the smile and erase button were switched i wouldn't accidentally type smiles when you i'm trying to erase.
3465	1353964790079	4	lentwelve ratingfour this app is probably the most important one you will ever download.
3466	1353964790079	4	lenfifteen ratingfour i am using it to type right now and it is basically reading my mind.
3467	1353964790079	4	lennine ratingfour this is the reason i stopped considering the iphone.
3468	1353964790079	4	leneight ratingfour i have shown so many people this keyboard.
3469	1353964790079	4	lentwentysix ratingfour update: i just got the lg optimus g and the cursor seems to be jumping to the top of the field in the middle of sentences.
3470	1353964258222	5	lentwo ratingfive amazing app!
3471	1353964258222	5	leneleven ratingfive worth every cent. i will never use the stock keyboard again.
3472	1353964258222	5	lenfive ratingfive the rapid typing is impressive.
3473	1353964258222	5	lenfour ratingfive bring on more themes.
3474	1353964258222	5	lenfive ratingfive love this app more everyday
3475	1353962586862	1	lenfourteen ratingone can't turn off the auto inserted space after a period or question mark.
3476	1353962586862	1	lennine ratingone all my messages now have extra spaces after them.
3477	1353962482017	3	lenseventeen ratingthree love this keyboard, but every time i turn the handset off and on it loses default settings.
3478	1353962482017	3	lenten ratingthree this drives me mad as the samsung keyboard is terrible.
3479	1353962482017	3	lennine ratingthree is this a problem with jb, the s3 or swiftkey?
3480	1353961662011	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour pro: extremely easy usability, nice layout, quick auto-correct and word prediction con: the app automatically add a space after the comma.
3481	1353961662011	4	lennineteen ratingfour not a big deal but i press the space bar every time and it auto add the 'and' word.
3482	1353961384746	5	lenfifteen ratingfive after using this keyboard now for several months i have had no problems with it.
3483	1353961384746	5	lennine ratingfive the themes are great and the usability is great.
3484	1353961384746	5	leneleven ratingfive the gb keyboard is awful and so is the ics keyboard.
3485	1353961384746	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this is a must have tool and it really makes your device much more usable.
3486	1353961384746	5	lentwentyone ratingfive only one problem is that i don't always get the w ord select option in some apps such as firefox.
3487	1353961384746	5	lenseven ratingfive but apart from that it's great.
3488	1353961272628	3	lensix ratingthree i quite like swiftkey's predictions.
3489	1353961272628	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree the few niggles i would like to overcome is i quite regularly get '.' when i haven't wanted to end the sentence.
3490	1353961272628	3	leneighteen ratingthree the 2nd part that is particularly irritating is that sometimes at the lock screen, i cannot input my password.
3491	1353961272628	3	leneleven ratingthree still it is enough to promote me to try another keyboard.
3492	1353961071876	4	leneight ratingfour love this keyboard, just a couple of things.
3493	1353961071876	4	lensixteen ratingfour google now on jellybean typing is very very slow and sluggish, works fine with stock keyboard.
3494	1353961071876	4	lenseventeen ratingfour sometimes, seemingly random, the auto-correct / predictions bar disappears but the rest of the keyboard still works.
3495	1353961071876	4	lentwenty ratingfour this is annoying, to fix just press back to close the keyboard, then select typing box to bring back up.
3496	1353961071876	4	lennine ratingfour this always fixes, very weird, not too bad though.
3497	1353961071876	4	lensix ratingfour cant wait for swift key flow!
3498	1353960627468	5	lentwenty ratingfive this keyboard surpasses all others i've used, it knows what i'm saying and it learns from your typing!
3499	1353960627468	5	leneight ratingfive it's fast, customisable and above all clever!
3500	1353960627468	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive got it in the sale so even happier but i'd have easily paid the full price, get the trial if you're sitting on the fence & it'll definitely sway you!
3501	1353959818110	1	lennineteen ratingone i used this keyboard for over a year and recently it has gotten very glitchy and i am uninstalling
3502	1353959078037	1	lentwelve ratingone hangs most of the time after update, i really hate it now.
3503	1353959078037	1	leneight ratingone sometimes it hangs as soon keyboard pops in.
3504	1353959078037	1	lentwelve ratingone no responses on clicking any button and keyboard does not pop down.
3505	1353959078037	1	lenfour ratingone very annoying nd irritating.
3506	1353959078037	1	leneighteen ratingone waste of money :( . please dont waste time buying this buggy app. please do test the app before releasing
3507	1353956234772	2	lensixteen ratingtwo galaxys3 it just doesn't work in any application or any browser for that matter  especially twitter.
3508	1353955921401	3	lenfortysix ratingthree it's the best keyboard i have used by far, and i love the themes (but maybe a couple more? or a way to make our own?) but it has issues with certain words like page, which it often automatically capitalizes or it will change "love"
3509	1353955921401	3	lensixteen ratingthree it appears to be a minor glitch and not an actual function of the keyboard itself.
3510	1353955921401	3	leneleven ratingthree in lieu of these issues being adjusted, i will give 5 stars.
3511	1353955921401	3	lensixteen ratingthree edit: half the time, dragging for punctuation deletes the word i'm typing since jb update. :( sgs3
3512	1353954372650	5	lentwo ratingfive briliant app.
3513	1353954372650	5	lenseventeen ratingfive easy, to go use and u also have tutorials when u use it for the first time.
3514	1353954372650	5	lensix ratingfive saved me over 15.000 keystrockes until now.
3515	1353954372650	5	lenfive ratingfive also has very nice themes.
3516	1353954372650	5	lenthree ratingfive totally worth buying.
3517	1353953793015	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard i've ever used.
3518	1353952829983	3	leneleven ratingthree i don't notice a big difference between this and stock.
3519	1353952829983	3	lentwentyfour ratingthree some of the layout designs annoy me and it takes a long-press to activate voice typing which is frustrating when in a hurry.
3520	1353952217160	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i don't like to buy apps but i tried the free trial of this and i had to buy it!
3521	1353951476785	5	lenseven ratingfive the only keyboard that works as promised
3522	1353950885751	3	lensix ratingthree it caused lagginess in search engine
3523	1353949854297	4	lenthirtyfive ratingfour amazing keyboard word prediction is absolutely amazing will deff improve anyone's typing one of its few but major down falls is the customization i'm coming from thumb keyboard where you can do anything.
3524	1353949854297	4	lenfiftythree ratingfour there's no where's near enough themes or even open ended options to make the keyboard look alittle appealing a needs tokeyboard is 90 percent accurate with 10 percent aesthetics i use my keyboard all the time i shouldn't hate what i'm looking at everytime other than that down right amazing keyboard
3525	1353947708080	1	lentwo ratingone droid razr.
3526	1353947708080	1	lentwenty ratingone constant problems typing, inserts random letters, pre-selects words i don't want, even sends texts before i'm finished.
3527	1353947274144	3	lenthirtyeight ratingthree bought for phone look not a problem but why should i pay for tablet version just let us buyers have it inc for free after all not allthe other apps charge for installing in a second larger device
3528	1353945586673	5	lentwo ratingfive excellent application.
3529	1353943608883	4	lenthirteen ratingfour not a bad keyboard, just wish it would not auto change words sometimes.
3530	1353943608883	4	lennine ratingfour i typed refer and it chose reference for example.
3531	1353943456021	5	leneight ratingfive could you add a new theme "red neon"
3532	1353943456021	5	leneleven ratingfive just like the blue neon (which is great by the way).
3533	1353943456021	5	leneight ratingfive other than that it's an awesome keyboard!
3534	1353943312817	3	lenthirty ratingthree on several occasions now i've had an alert that says there are no keyboards loaded, but when i click the alert and click languages the keyboard is already selected.
3535	1353943312817	3	leneighteen ratingthree update: if i have no connection when the error occurs i can't use the keyboard at all!
3536	1353940814002	5	lenten ratingfive i have been using the application for a week now.
3537	1353940814002	5	lenseven ratingfive it's way better than stock application.
3538	1353940650200	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it's like part of my texting lifestyle :)) it predicts what i type!
3539	1353940650200	5	lenfour ratingfive definitely worth it buying!
3540	1353940630051	4	leneleven ratingfour my girlfriend is taiwanese and she uses my phone a lot.
3541	1353940630051	4	lenfive ratingfour can you add traditional chinese?
3542	1353940560751	5	lensix ratingfive best transition app from a blackberry.
3543	1353940560751	5	leneighteen ratingfive it knows what your going to write and corrects any mistakes better than anything i've ever seen.
3544	1353940560751	5	leneight ratingfive this beats auto correct on iphone bar none!
3545	1353940560751	5	lennine ratingfive keep up the good work and keep giving updates
3546	1353940504699	5	lentwelve ratingfive best app ever, its like having auto correct 50 years in the future
3547	1353936509199	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i can really type fast with this app without making any mistakes due to the auto correction.
3548	1353935164865	5	lenfive ratingfive it works like a charm.
3549	1353935164865	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i used to create a lot of typo but somehow it knows what i intend to type.
3550	1353935164865	5	lenseven ratingfive you will be amused by its accuracy.
3551	1353935164865	5	lenthree ratingfive thanks its awesome.
3552	1353883851907	3	lenfive ratingthree intelligent but not intelligent enough.
3553	1353883851907	3	lentwentyeight ratingthree being a person with a good vocabulary, i still find myself back spacing every few words because this keyboard is far too casual in its suggestions and predictions.
3554	1353883851907	3	lentwentyone ratingthree it may be good for some but not if you're looking for professional eloquence-even in your every day typing.
3555	1353883851907	3	lenten ratingthree i would pay one dollar for this app-not four.
3556	1353883851907	3	lenfifteen ratingthree it's a shame that the app refund period lasts for so short a time.
3557	1353883049350	3	lensix ratingthree this keyboard is great so far.
3558	1353883049350	3	lenfifteen ratingthree but can you include the use of mandrin han yu pin yin text predictions please?
3559	1353881698125	4	lennineteen ratingfour i like it,  simple to configure and use and saves me time from editing my messages after quick typing.
3560	1353881698125	4	leneight ratingfour i recommend for anybody looking for quicker productivity.
3561	1353879441519	2	lenfour ratingtwo it jumps around spontaneously.
3562	1353879441519	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo i am typing and i'm in a totally different sentence for no reason.
3563	1353878599282	5	lenfive ratingfive i just love this keyboard.
3564	1353878599282	5	leneleven ratingfive it predicts your next word before you even think about it.
3565	1353878599282	5	leneight ratingfive makes typing on a phone so much easier.
3566	1353878599282	5	lennine ratingfive a big thanks to the developers of this application.
3567	1353878204482	4	lennine ratingfour also doesnt have a feature to minimize the keyboard.
3568	1353878204482	4	lentwelve ratingfour i could not access a certain app one time because of this.
3569	1353878073236	5	lenfour ratingfive best keyboard for android
3570	1353877392457	5	lenthirteen ratingfive totally worth every penny,  a no brainer my hats off to the developers
3571	1353877308872	2	lensix ratingtwo okcupid messages do not support predictions.
3572	1353877308872	2	lenseven ratingtwo very annoying especially when trying to flirt.
3573	1353877308872	2	lenthree ratingtwo otherwise great app.
3574	1353876454339	1	lensix ratingone worked a couple times before crashing.
3575	1353876454339	1	lentwenty ratingone now can't get beyond choosing english language download due to 'network error', no matter how good my connection is.
3576	1353876454339	1	lenfour ratingone have reinstalled several times.
3577	1353876336362	5	lenthree ratingfive odli?na tipkovnica
3578	1353874504364	5	lenfive ratingfive perfect, add more keyboard themes (:
3579	1353871548877	4	lentwenty ratingfour the only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is because it'll occasionally go away while i'm typing.
3580	1353871548877	4	leneleven ratingfour it might accidentally read downward swipes when i'm typing fast.
3581	1353871548877	4	leneighteen ratingfour an option to disabled certain gestures (i love the left swipe to delete entire words) would be great.
3582	1353871193222	5	leneighteen ratingfive i left swiftkey for touch pal, and but found swift key more accurate, but so i am back.
3583	1353871193222	5	lentwelve ratingfive i sell mobile phones for a living, i only recommend this one.
3584	1353871193222	5	lensix ratingfive those that try it, buy it!
3585	1353871172726	4	lentwelve ratingfour predictions not working in browser, wish letter boxes were wider like iphone.
3586	1353871172726	4	lensix ratingfour does save a lot of strokes.
3587	1353870890616	5	lenfive ratingfive best keyboard on the market
3588	1353869032938	5	lenfortytwo ratingfive this keyboard app is very awesome because the keyboards my phone came with just sucked and made me mess up a lot, but this one, it's predicated many words i was gonna say and also has a really good auto correct.
3589	1353869032938	5	lensixteen ratingfive the layout and software is just so awesome and im using it to type right now.
3590	1353867203143	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i'm not going to lie, this is hands down insanely accurate and we'll worth the 2$, i would've paid double the amount.
3591	1353867203143	5	lentwo ratingfive freakishly accurate
3592	1353866638007	5	lenthree ratingfive excellent keyboard app!
3593	1353866379088	5	leneight ratingfive do i need to purchase swiftkey flow again?
3594	1353865966701	4	leneleven ratingfour great product but doesn't support swedish usb or bt keyboard.
3595	1353865966701	4	leneleven ratingfour this is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars.
3596	1353864661071	3	lensixteen ratingthree this app is sweet but no custom dictionary makes me wish i hadn't bought it.
3597	1353864146898	3	leneleven ratingthree i like it's ability to predict what i'm writing.
3598	1353864146898	3	lentwelve ratingthree i don't like the way that it handles using different languages.
3599	1353864146898	3	leneighteen ratingthree i wish there was a way to toggle between languages instead of having them integrated into one keyboard.
3600	1353861391509	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this keyboard.
3601	1353861391509	5	leneight ratingfive this gives the best suggestions based on history.
3602	1353860320825	5	lenfortyfour ratingfive for me its the best keyboard ( only tested the free ones ) even tho was the best app i used for 30days i dint wanted to pay the full price ( i hate paying for apps that cost more than ?2 ) so i am happy for this sale!
3603	1353860320825	5	lenten ratingfive dint think twice and just bought it, ?1.49 was a steal.
3604	1353856013057	5	lenthirtyfour ratingfive i love this keyboard, easily the best app you could give to your phone, but the only thing that is missing from this keyboard is the ability to go between typing and swype typing.
3605	1353856013057	5	lenfourteen ratingfive if this was somehow integrated into this keyboard i would be a happy customer.
3606	1353856013057	5	lenfour ratingfive keep the updates coming!
3607	1354483739284	5	lenfive ratingfive best keyboard app out there.
3608	1354481430688	5	lentwentythree ratingfive this app is amazing work perfect only have to type like two letters and it already knows what i'm going to say.
3609	1354481430688	5	lensix ratingfive download it you'll love it!
3610	1354476630072	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive my only gripe is that when i hit close to the 'i'  key i sometimes hit the 'u' key instead,  and i never use u for you so this bothers me.
3611	1354476630072	5	lenfour ratingfive anyway,  best 4$ spent ever!
3612	1354475599914	4	leneight ratingfour 1 suggestion, pls add more theme for this app.
3613	1354475599914	4	lensix ratingfour overall its a really great app.
3614	1354474580389	1	lenseventeen ratingone it doesn't support one hand operation which is so essential for the giant screen of note 2.
3615	1354474580389	1	lenten ratingone will reverie my rating and comment once it's launched
3616	1354471770097	4	lentwentyseven ratingfour i'm not sure if it's a phone issue or a swiftkey issue, but anytime i restart my phone it defaults back to the samsung keyboard.
3617	1354469275765	3	lenfour ratingthree not worth the money.
3618	1354469275765	3	lentwelve ratingthree i use the swipe on android and this keyboard  dont have it
3619	1354468828673	3	leneight ratingthree the predictive typing is awesome and surprisingly accurate.
3620	1354468828673	3	lenten ratingthree i don't like how laggy it can be sometimes.
3621	1354468828673	3	lentwelve ratingthree it is especially bad when i switch between numbers/symbols and letters.
3622	1354468828673	3	leneighteen ratingthree i also have speed issues when i'm touch typing like i would on the normal android keyboard.
3623	1354468828673	3	lensixteen ratingthree i'm much faster on the normal keyboard and i'd rather just use that one.
3624	1354468828673	3	lensixteen ratingthree i could see how some people would find this useful though and it does save keystrokes.
3625	1354468403326	3	leneight ratingthree ch?a c¨® g? ti?ng vi?t nam.
3626	1354462851495	4	leneight ratingfour but please add swipe right as a redo.
3627	1354462851495	4	leneleven ratingfour (swipe left deletes a word,  so swipe left undoes that deletion).
3628	1354462851495	4	lenseven ratingfour i often find myself accidentally deleting words.
3629	1354462259943	3	lenfourteen ratingthree its take so much time for pop up and its typing speed is slow
3630	1354461281362	5	lenfour ratingfive works perfectly on note 2.
3631	1354461281362	5	lensix ratingfive makes typing much easier and faster!
3632	1354460220850	3	lentwelve ratingthree i really liked this app before when i had the trial version.
3633	1354460220850	3	lenfour ratingthree worked like a charm.
3634	1354460220850	3	lensixteen ratingthree then ai bought it and all of a sudden the app sometimes doesn't even work.
3635	1354460220850	3	lenfourteen ratingthree the predictions don't show up and it won't auto correct my words.
3636	1354460220850	3	lennine ratingthree its not worth all the money i paid anymore.
3637	1354460220850	3	lenseven ratingthree fix this problem and ill rate 5 stars.
3638	1354460220850	3	leneight ratingthree its frustrating for it to only work sometimes.
3639	1354457286915	5	lenthirtyseven ratingfive i haven't used this keyboard in awhile due to being satisfied with the jellybean keyboard on my galaxy nexus, however since getting the razr m i've started to look for alternative and stopped at swiftkey.
3640	1354457286915	5	lensix ratingfive can't wait for swiftkey flow.
3641	1354456736421	5	lenten ratingfive swiftkey.what a great app that works like a charm
3642	1354454161441	1	lenfifteen ratingone my version has a few misspelled words that it automatically displays in the predictions window.
3643	1354454161441	1	lenseven ratingone cannot edit the dictionary to remove them.
3644	1354454161441	1	lenseventeen ratingone otherwise it's a big step back from swiftkey x.  smartspace is terrible, unadjustable, and too invasive.
3645	1354454161441	1	lenten ratingone fyi: swiftkey doesn't like the moto lapdock at all.
3646	1354454161441	1	lenthirteen ratingone a truly fantastic program has been rendered just another app with with bugs.
3647	1354453864404	5	lenseven ratingfive the best android keyboard out there, period.
3648	1354453864404	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive within two months this thing had learned the way i type so well, that it can even when rather drunk, my texts make sense!
3649	1354448771126	4	leneight ratingfour the keyboard sputtered and word prediction is amazing.
3650	1354448771126	4	lenseventeen ratingfour at the same time however it's marred by it's prediction service at the same time.
3651	1354448771126	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour certain behaviors like automatic spacing after periods are a pain in the @$$ when trying to type in my email address that has periods in it.
3652	1354448771126	4	lenten ratingfour an option that disables automatic spacing after punctuation is necessary.
3653	1354448771126	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i would also like to see an option to edit the personal dictionary.
3654	1354448771126	4	lentwelve ratingfour in the meantime i will be using swype and the stock keyboard.
3655	1354441337235	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive probably the last worry on my mind when i was so use to texting on my iphone was how i would be able to text on my android.
3656	1354441337235	5	lenthree ratingfive mahalo's swiftkey 3!
3657	1354440502020	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i've been using this keyboard since i brought this phone, have done trying tons of keyboard and still, return to this every time.
3658	1354437899151	4	lentwelve ratingfour its a great keyboard however i wish it suppoerted the samsung swipe.
3659	1354436996602	2	lentwenty ratingtwo as mentioned in title, please consider to add numeric key at top row, this will significantly improve the typing speed
3660	1354570987232	5	lenfourteen ratingfive truly changes the way my android device handles my typing styles on various formats.
3661	1354570987232	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive my only concern is that when entering emails the app needs to recognize that you are doing so and needs to adjust accordingly (eithout automatically spacing after periods, auto capatilizing letters for certain email addresses).
3662	1354570987232	5	lensix ratingfive other than that, a superb app!
3663	1354570987232	5	lenthree ratingfive money well spent!
3664	1354570791577	5	lentwelve ratingfive the best taxting apps on the market i recommend this to everyone.
3665	1354568816702	2	lenthree ratingtwo yaay for urdu.
3666	1354568816702	2	lenfive ratingtwo but really bad performance on 4.1.
3667	1354568816702	2	lenseven ratingtwo hangs often and really slow button response.
3668	1354564630077	5	lenthirty ratingfive i haven't used this keyboard for that long but it feels like i have been missing out all this time when i was using the other third party keyboards.
3669	1354564630077	5	lenseventeen ratingfive since using this app it haven't changed a phrase that i use to something completely different.
3670	1354564630077	5	lenfourteen ratingfive keep up the good work because i'm happy that i purchased this app.
3671	1354559250789	4	lennine ratingfour i love how accurite it is when i type.
3672	1354559250789	4	lenseventeen ratingfour i'm a rapid texter and this is so much better than the stock keyboard from android.
3673	1354559250789	4	leneighteen ratingfour the only issue i have is that it is slow to start up at times in most apps.
3674	1354559250789	4	lennine ratingfour i have the galaxy nexus, with the aokp rom.
3675	1354559250789	4	lenthirteen ratingfour please fix the slow start up times and this is a perfect keyboard!
3676	1354558923659	4	lenfifteen ratingfour i love this keyboard but have started having an issue after upgrade to jelly bean.
3677	1354558923659	4	lentwentythree ratingfour the predictions row gets turned off each time i wake the screen if the keyboard was open when the screen goes to sleep.
3678	1354558923659	4	lenten ratingfour if i close the keyboard and reopen, predictions come back.
3679	1354558923659	4	lennine ratingfour this is a 5 star product when this is fixed.
3680	1354558869023	5	lenfour ratingfive better than factory installed.
3681	1354558528281	5	lensix ratingfive finally a keyboard that suits me!
3682	1354558528281	5	lenseven ratingfive i highly recommend it this to anyone.
3683	1354558523419	5	leneleven ratingfive works much better than the pre installed keyboard on my galaxy s3.
3684	1354554494013	5	lenfour ratingfive persian language ia awesome.
3685	1354554494013	5	lenthree ratingfive hi persians (iranians) ;-)
3686	1354551113361	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard.
3687	1354551113361	5	lentwo ratingfive freekishly accurate!
3688	1354551113361	5	lenfourteen ratingfive my friends couldn't believe that everything came out 100 percent accurate when typing like.
3689	1354551113361	5	lenseven ratingfive let's get some more themes now! ;-)
3690	1354549419893	4	lenfive ratingfour used to be 5 star earlier.
3691	1354549419893	4	lenseventeen ratingfour but now that i use voice input, there is no easy way of inserting a full stop.
3692	1354549419893	4	lenfourteen ratingfour google voice input enters al words correctly but hardly inserts any fullstop or comma.
3693	1354549419893	4	lentwentynine ratingfour add a feature so that while talking to the mobile, there is another button beside the mic icon to insert a fullstop and you willl get your 5 stars back!
3694	1354548358256	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this is the best keyboard i have found on here and i have had many!
3695	1354548358256	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive certainly the best for typing, the only thing i would like you to improve in a upcoming update is maybe a few more themes?
3696	1354548358256	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive as petty as it sounds i would love a red keyboard to match the rest of my phone's theme and case!
3697	1354548358256	5	leneighteen ratingfive using the 'pumpkin' theme at the moment as it is the closest one to my theme:)  thank you!
3698	1354546973593	5	lenfour ratingfive so worth the money!
3699	1354546973593	5	lennine ratingfive it's like it knows what i'm thinking.
3700	1354546973593	5	lenten ratingfive the corrections are even more accurate than the iphone keyboard.
3701	1354546973593	5	lenfour ratingfive love the 10 key too!
3702	1354546065887	5	lenfour ratingfive freakishly accurate at times.
3703	1354546065887	5	lentwelve ratingfive i'm really looking to the flow update to go with it.
3704	1354545012202	4	lennine ratingfour all we need is chinese input (i prefer strokes)
3705	1354542975663	5	lenfourteen ratingfive had my android 3 years now and this is the first app i've purchased.
3706	1354542975663	5	lenseven ratingfive this should illustrate how great it is.
3707	1354541548777	1	lensix ratingone no word prediction in various browsers.
3708	1354541548777	1	lenthree ratingone makes no sense.
3709	1354541548777	1	lenfive ratingone no dedicated # row option either.
3710	1354541548777	1	leneight ratingone company could care less about adding real functionality.
3711	1354541548777	1	lensixteen ratingone feature requests for real functionality sit and collect dust while fluff skinning type ones get done.
3712	1354541548777	1	leneight ratingone thank god i got it for a dime.
3713	1354538644068	3	lenfifteen ratingthree if only you can move cursor by sliding finger accros the keyboard, not with arrows.
3714	1354536836290	5	leneight ratingfive it almost seems like it reads your mind.
3715	1354533975943	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this keyboard does everything and can be modified to look and feel how you want!
3716	1354533975943	5	lentwelve ratingfive this must be the first app installed on every droid world wide
3717	1354533634403	1	lentwentytwo ratingone it's been months since hundreds if not thousands of users faithfully and trustingly waiting for the additional of chinese language support.
3718	1354533634403	1	lenten ratingone but with more languages added,chinese never made the list.
3719	1354533634403	1	lenten ratingone i am sick of how paid users are being treated.
3720	1354533634403	1	lentwenty ratingone yes you may have made my money, but rest assure i will never ever recommend this app to anyone else.
3721	1354533634403	1	lentwentyfour ratingone and to all other who is considering getting this app, if you like to be ignored then this is the right app for you.
3722	1354530974006	3	lensixteen ratingthree swiftkey makes my typing hella fast and easier but there need to have a chinese input.
3723	1354524841372	4	leneight ratingfour 1 suggestion, pls add more theme for this app
3724	1354524704876	5	lensix ratingfive i really like this keyboard app
3725	1354521926638	5	lentwelve ratingfive i've tried so many and always come back to this one.
3726	1354521926638	5	lenthirteen ratingfive if they could integrate a bit of slide like flext9 it would be unbeatable.
3727	1354521926638	5	lenten ratingfive and here they are with swiftkey flow around the corner.
3728	1354521926638	5	leneight ratingfive the future is very bright for this company.
3729	1354520517808	3	lentwelve ratingthree auto correct and predictions only work on few apps for jelly bean.
3730	1354520517808	3	lennine ratingthree can't even get it for the default browser.
3731	1354520517808	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree also, when i have the keyboard enabled, it for some reason disables the handwriting feature in the samsung keyboard for the note 2
3732	1354519919682	4	lennineteen ratingfour i like this a lot more than the standard key pad thing, would get 5 stars if you added swype.
3733	1354519919682	4	leneleven ratingfour i can live without it but would be a nice addition
3734	1354510089243	5	lenthree ratingfive love the keys
3735	1354506001157	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this is the only app i've ever bought and the only keyboard i use
3736	1354505549107	5	lentwo ratingfive more themes!
3737	1354503349877	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive after blasting a previous version of this app which had major usability glitches, i have to say that this is now my favourite keyboard.
3738	1354503349877	5	lenten ratingfive being in montreal, i switch between french and english constantly.
3739	1354503349877	5	lenthirteen ratingfive swiftkey runs both languages simultaneously so i don't actually have to switch.
3740	1354503349877	5	lenfifteen ratingfive it knows which language i'm typing in and corrects or suggests the appropriate word.
3741	1354503349877	5	lennine ratingfive what's amazing is how accurate the predictions are.
3742	1354503349877	5	lenfifteen ratingfive in the near totality of cases, the suggested or corrected word is the right one.
3743	1354500755732	5	lenthirteen ratingfive the keyboard does vibrate, it's in the settings in swiftkey (haptic feedback) .
3744	1354500755732	5	leneleven ratingfive i've had swiftkey for 2 yrs now and still love it!
3745	1354500224782	1	leneight ratingone i can download any language except for english.
3746	1354500224782	1	lensix ratingone people have been saying this forever.
3747	1354500224782	1	lenseven ratingone fix it, and you'll have 5 stars.
3748	1354499085847	2	lensix ratingtwo **still not saving any new words!
3749	1354499085847	2	lenseventeen ratingtwo please fix, it's getting annoying**  seems to have totally forgotten a lot of my saved words.
3750	1354499085847	2	leneighteen ratingtwo also if i type too fast it just deletes the word and i have to type it again.
3751	1354499085847	2	lennine ratingtwo other than that, this is the best keyboard app
3752	1354498854576	5	lenfive ratingfive best typing app out there.
3753	1354498854576	5	lenfifteen ratingfive what can i say but with smartphones being so small i could never type right.
3754	1354498854576	5	lenfourteen ratingfive now i barley have to since swift key3 was downloaded it basically types for me
3755	1354496529732	3	lenthree ratingthree great alternative keyboard.
3756	1354496529732	3	lennine ratingthree changed to three stars because it loves the battery.
3757	1354496529732	3	lenten ratingthree cut my s iii's battery time almost in half.
3758	1354494746021	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree plz make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz make the key board respond faster
3759	1354486192866	5	lenten ratingfive i have the galaxy s3 and the only flaw is text.
3760	1354486192866	5	lentwelve ratingfive i have huge fingers and swipe doesn't work well for me.
3761	1354486192866	5	lenseven ratingfive i was forced to hunt and peck.
3762	1354486192866	5	lenten ratingfive now i text just as fast as my teenage niece!
3763	1354486192866	5	lenfive ratingfive well worth the four bucks.
3764	1354652879479	5	lenthree ratingfive switched from slideit.
3765	1354652879479	5	lenthree ratingfive totally worth it.
3766	1354652879479	5	lenthirteen ratingfive and you can use different dictionaries without having to switch the whole time!
3767	1354652879479	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommended.
3768	1354649092372	3	lentwenty ratingthree it was a nice app but the search for the % key led me to go back to the native keyboard.
3769	1354649092372	3	lenfourteen ratingthree didn't play nice when i was switching between voice commands and native keyboard.
3770	1354649092372	3	lennineteen ratingthree then i realized how much bigger the keys were on the native keyboard (rezound) compared to the swiftkey keys.
3771	1354649092372	3	lenthirtynine ratingthree the automatic spacing between words when selected off the top was useful, but once i got used to hitting the space bar every time, i saw no advantage to layering another app on top of something that worked satisfactorily.
3772	1354643501431	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i love this keyboard i will never use another crappie android keyboard again!
3773	1354643501431	5	lenthree ratingfive no issues whatsoever.
3774	1354643501431	5	leneight ratingfive but would like to see more colors please!
3775	1354642751243	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this is the best keyboard ever, but it eats quite a lot of ram
3776	1354642297255	3	lennine ratingthree jelly bean resets swiftkey when the phone is restarted.
3777	1354642191542	5	lenseventeen ratingfive if you come from ios, you know the day and night different between the two stock keyboards.
3778	1354642191542	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive android keyboard is suck but i can assure u that this keyboard will make your life on android phone a lot better.
3779	1354642070360	5	lenthree ratingfive truly great keyboard.
3780	1354642070360	5	lenfive ratingfive the predictions are stunningly accurate.
3781	1354642070360	5	lentwelve ratingfive my favourite feature is that it can handle more than one language.
3782	1354642070360	5	lenfive ratingfive no need to switch manually.
3783	1354641012786	5	lensix ratingfive any chance to add chinese language?
3784	1354640587576	5	lenfive ratingfive best keyboard i've used.
3785	1354640587576	5	lensix ratingfive just wish you could swipe also
3786	1354639862641	5	lenseven ratingfive it predicts what i want to write.
3787	1354639862641	5	lenfifteen ratingfive plus it's really useful to write using with different languages at the same time!
3788	1354639219918	1	lenfour ratingone main problem prediction (lithuanian).
3789	1354639219918	1	lenthirteen ratingone would be more stars if there was possibility to turn off the prediction.
3790	1354635924421	3	leneighteen ratingthree this app used to be great, it would accurately predict when i was typing all over the place.
3791	1354635924421	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree now it seems to be making up its own words and not correct anything even when i have cleared the language data.
3792	1354633516087	3	lenten ratingthree it needs a number row like the stock note keyboard
3793	1354628139931	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo when i use this keyboard on my gs3 it is very unresponsive and laggy.
3794	1354615868169	5	lenseven ratingfive 100x better than the default keyboard for android
3795	1354612049560	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive i hated my keyboard when i went from s2 to s3 but after downloading i have a new love for my phone again. :-) thanks a must download.!
3796	1354611421060	5	lenseven ratingfive at first i regretted making the switch.
3797	1354611421060	5	lenfour ratingfive the s3 keyboard is garbage.
3798	1354611421060	5	lenfifteen ratingfive with this keyboard its beast, text just like i phone and super easy to use.
3799	1354611014432	5	lenten ratingfive it makes you coherent when otherwise you wouldn't be.
3800	1354611014432	5	lennineteen ratingfive the best at predictions beating android native because it adds and learns new words automatically rather than manual adding.
3801	1354611014432	5	lenten ratingfive predictions surprisingly accurate based on historic usage of words together.
3802	1354611014432	5	lenthree ratingfive worth the money.
3803	1354611014432	5	lenthree ratingfive lots of options.
3804	1354611014432	5	leneighteen ratingfive just gone from galaxy sii to note ii and it helps to be able to adjust key height.
3805	1354611014432	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive by the way for the review saying you can't remove words that you don't use, you can by long pressing and clicking remove on the predictions
3806	1354606118368	5	lenseventeen ratingfive defiantly would recommend this keyboard to anyone that would like to be more effective typing on touchscreens.
3807	1354606118368	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive only complaint is the amount of ram needed and the delay that occurs when closing the keyboard after hitting the home button.
3808	1354606118368	5	leneighteen ratingfive very small problems when compared to this amount of effort and time that this keyboard has saved me.
3809	1354606076396	5	lenten ratingfive it is an excellent app, and it learns really quickly.
3810	1354606076396	5	lentwelve ratingfive it looks good, and gives your keyboard a nice finish.worth buying
3811	1354604324937	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i've been using this for over a year, and of all the apps i use, this is probably the most essential.
3812	1354601876016	4	leneleven ratingfour i will support you if you add support for japanese language.
3813	1354601876016	4	lentwentythree ratingfour it kinda annoys me that it has persian (who in the world speaks persian) and not such a widely known language as japanese.
3814	1354601602346	5	lenten ratingfive its an awesome keyboard to replace the built in ones
3815	1354601330239	5	lenfour ratingfive finally i could text.
3816	1354599879361	5	lenthree ratingfive more themes please.
3817	1354596202796	5	lenthree ratingfive love the keyboard!
3818	1354596202796	5	lenseven ratingfive now i'm just waiting on flow!
3819	1354595230462	5	lenfive ratingfive can't wait for flow!
3820	1354594018755	4	leneight ratingfour only request is for a collapse keyboard button.
3821	1354594018755	4	lenseven ratingfour sometimes buttons like that are just needed.
3822	1354593766389	5	lensix ratingfive love this app on my note 2
3823	1354593599704	1	lensix ratingone time for more themes thank u
3824	1354593467363	5	leneight ratingfive love it, all it needs is more themes.
3825	1354593182147	5	lentwenty ratingfive i'm not a typer but this app makes me look like i've been doing it all my life.
3826	1354593182147	5	lentwo ratingfive great app.
3827	1354591380016	4	lenten ratingfour i'll give 5 stars when the jellybean issue is fixed.
3828	1354590735863	1	lenten ratingone i want to see performance increased for the samsung galaxy s3.
3829	1354590454992	5	lennine ratingfive had the free version loaded for about a month.
3830	1354590454992	5	lenseven ratingfive it only made my typing more efficient.
3831	1354590454992	5	lentwentyone ratingfive they have stats in the app to illustrate the improvement - but it's not too hard to see on your own.
3832	1354590454992	5	leneight ratingfive all the app really lacks is more themes.
3833	1354590454992	5	leneight ratingfive but it does it's job freakishly well.
3834	1354590454992	5	lenfour ratingfive well worth the keesh.
3835	1354590338017	5	lentwentyone ratingfive it just works, i don't even have to press the space button and it still knows what i'm saying!
3836	1354589453348	5	leneight ratingfive good keyboard but, can we disable the prediction?
3837	1354589453348	5	lenfour ratingfive the theme is awesome
3838	1354586886498	5	lenseven ratingfive awesome auto correct, fast to type on.
3839	1354586886498	5	lenfive ratingfive reliable and easy to use.
3840	1354586886498	5	lenten ratingfive once the swype features are added it'll be unrivalled!
3841	1354586316371	5	lenfive ratingfive can't wait for flow
3842	1354585713921	5	lenfive ratingfive release swift key flow alreadyyyyyy!
3843	1354585516225	5	lenthirteen ratingfive just wish you had more themes or ability to make a custom theme.
3844	1354583895497	1	lentwelve ratingone no where near as accurate as they fake it in the video.
3845	1354583895497	1	lenseventeen ratingone one of the first things they teach you about android is to look at permissions for apps.
3846	1354583895497	1	lenfifteen ratingone this is true for both malicious apps and legitimate apps that could cause security concerns.
3847	1354583895497	1	lentwenty ratingone i dont know what the dev thought when he decided to ask for email and facebook access (major security concern).
3848	1354583895497	1	lensixteen ratingone the trade off for this security concern is text prediction no better than any other keyboard.
3849	1354583895497	1	lensix ratingone be smart and avoid this one.
3850	1354581979423	4	leneighteen ratingfour i have had this keyboard in he past and have yet to find another quite like this one.
3851	1354581748978	2	lentwentyfour ratingtwo it's well known that it's a poor business practice to make your existing customers suddenly pay more to use an existing product.
3852	1354581748978	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo suddenly charging existing customers for use on tablets smacks of lousy business acumen.
3853	1354578348701	2	lennineteen ratingtwo the app is supposed to allow y to delete mistaken words you don't want in the language model.
3854	1354578348701	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo i press and hold the prediction, and there is no option to delete!
3855	1354578348701	2	lenten ratingtwo it's really annoying because common typos then become predictions
3856	1354577901340	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i've been using this for a fair few months now and it's fantastic!
3857	1354577901340	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommend.
3858	1354577901340	5	lentwelve ratingfive i can write whole texts pretty much by just typing one word!
3859	1354576710011	3	lenseventeen ratingthree after reboot im locked back into the samsung keyboard, help me it is already set for default
3860	1354575418997	4	lentwelve ratingfour but the only downside is that since jellybean update its constantly "forget"
3861	1354575418997	4	lenfour ratingfour the default keyboard selection.
3862	1354575418997	4	lennine ratingfour doesn't happen in other keyboards on the market :-(
3863	1354573555022	5	lenfour ratingfive for the support team.
3864	1354573555022	5	leneleven ratingfive very kind and accurate, i have really appreciate the quick answer.
3865	1354573555022	5	lenfourteen ratingfive the keyword is awesome, makes me feel like i speak languages i don't ;)
3866	1354573083552	3	lenseventeen ratingthree overall product quality is very good except it's user defined library doesn't work with whatsapp.
3867	1354573083552	3	lensix ratingthree which is already became sms replacement.
3868	1354573083552	3	lennine ratingthree because of whatsapp issue i can just give 3 stars.
3869	1354743817296	5	lentwentyone ratingfive coming from a full qwerty slider, this app has relieved most of my annoyance with having to type on a touchscreen.
3870	1354743817296	5	lennineteen ratingfive its ability to make predictions for several languages simultaneously is a big deal, and missing in most competing products.
3871	1354743682341	5	lenseven ratingfive would love to see more themes though!
3872	1354741157805	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree this is a brilliant app for predicting words etc.but no compact qwerty option which i think is essential in portrait view
3873	1354740092409	4	lentwelve ratingfour jedine co mi chybi dlouhodobe a nech¨¢pu proc u? to d¨¢vno nepridali, jsou zkratky!
3874	1354740092409	4	lenfive ratingfour p?itom mnoho u?ivatel?
3875	1354740092409	4	lensixteen ratingfour by si to p?¨¢la a p¨ª?e o to v?voj¨¢?m. ?tve me po?¨¢d vypisovat email atd.
3876	1354740092409	4	lenfive ratingfour tak?e sni?uji hodnocen¨ª na 4* :-(
3877	1354739754867	2	lenfive ratingtwo not compatible with jelly bean.
3878	1354739754867	2	lenfive ratingtwo resets after boot or restart.
3879	1354738379146	5	lennineteen ratingfive this app is a must have i make sure i have it installed on every android phone i get.
3880	1354738379146	5	lensix ratingfive more themes would be appreciated dev.
3881	1354738372910	5	lensix ratingfive always remembers everything i wrote before
3882	1354731809045	4	lennine ratingfour it's so awesome how well the prediction is.
3883	1354731809045	4	leneight ratingfour please please please revert back to a seperate "!"
3884	1354731809045	4	leneight ratingfour button like in the old version of swiftkey.
3885	1354731809045	4	lenseven ratingfour way more often than the letter "q".
3886	1354731809045	4	lenfour ratingfour 1 button for 3 common keys?
3887	1354731809045	4	lensixteen ratingfour in fact, you can get rid of the keys altogether and just have one big pad.
3888	1354731809045	4	leneight ratingfour we all know what the keyboard layout is.
3889	1354731809045	4	lentwo ratingfour pro mode.
3890	1354731809045	4	lenseven ratingfour but please have a separate key for "!"
3891	1354726227716	5	lensix ratingfive much better than any stock keyboard.
3892	1354726227716	5	leneighteen ratingfive its prediction and auto correct are much better than any other keyboard i've used, stock or not.
3893	1354722912024	5	lenten ratingfive but i'm still going to rate this keyboard 5 stars.
3894	1354722912024	5	lennineteen ratingfive it's simply the best keyboard around and i love that you can change themes, keeps everything feeling fresh.
3895	1354722912024	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i heard 4.1.2 update fixes the default keyboard issue so i'll just have to wait.
3896	1354722588802	5	lensix ratingfive i'm astounded by this app.
3897	1354722588802	5	lenthirtythree ratingfive one thing it needs is the ability to change to the writing pad as i am using the galaxy note 2 and sometimes i prefer it that way, otherwise this is almost near perfect.
3898	1354716656480	5	lenseven ratingfive love this keyboard, my samsung keyboard sucks
3899	1354715795814	4	lentwo ratingfour great app.
3900	1354715795814	4	lenten ratingfour the only thing i would add is more customisation options!
3901	1354714751085	2	lentwenty ratingtwo this app is very good w/ english  but arabic layout is very annoying, please use windows layout instead of mac
3902	1354714434153	5	leneleven ratingfive best keyboard on the app store, unparalleled accuracy for the prediction
3903	1354710497283	5	lenthree ratingfive a wonderful keyboard.
3904	1354710497283	5	lentwenty ratingfive i come from ios and the predictions and word completions for their keyboards and their dictionary is second to none.
3905	1354710497283	5	lenten ratingfive swiftkey however is rapidly approaching and is a wonderful transition.
3906	1354710497283	5	lenfour ratingfive definitely worth the buy!
3907	1354704434619	4	lenfive ratingfour no comment at this time
3908	1354701940156	5	lenten ratingfive for a moment i cheated on you with go keyboard.
3909	1354701940156	5	leneight ratingfive i love you pumpkin, you are the best
3910	1354699792998	5	lensixteen ratingfive as soon as i upgraded from my old incredible this was the first app i reinstalled.
3911	1354699792998	5	lenseven ratingfive best keyboard you can have no doubt.
3912	1354697472607	4	lenten ratingfour i like this keyboard, it really learns how i write.
3913	1354697472607	4	lenthirteen ratingfour but why does it take up 27 mb of ram on my galaxy nexus?
3914	1354697472607	4	leneighteen ratingfour the next closes one is lookout with 14 mb, just about half of what swiftkey uses, both while idle.
3915	1354697472607	4	lentwenty ratingfour i know there should be a lot of ram left on most modern phone, but that is not my point.
3916	1354697472607	4	leneighteen ratingfour the more ram programs use the less program you can run efficiently, slowing down the phone in general.
3917	1354697472607	4	lensixteen ratingfour i have other app i rarely use, but they still use ram for no apparent reason.
3918	1354697472607	4	lentwentyseven ratingfour i uninstall them, i don't want to uninstall swiftkey, but the native keyboard is catching up with swiftkey and would have ram usage on my phone.
3919	1354697472607	4	leneight ratingfour everything else about the swiftkey keyboard is great.
3920	1354697472607	4	lenfourteen ratingfour for most people how only istall a few apps swiftkey is a must install.
3921	1354697472607	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i am not like most people, i try and use a lot of apps.
3922	1354697472607	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour often i notice slowdown on my phone and find app taking up ram for no reason and have to uninstall the hogs.
3923	1354697472607	4	lenthirteen ratingfour this is similar to the memory leak problem firefox has on the desktop.
3924	1354697472607	4	lensixteen ratingfour most people don't notice it, but if you do, it really starts to bug you!
3925	1354695301901	5	lenfifteen ratingfive .feature then i may return but since gs3 jb update enabled swype keyboard using that instead.
3926	1354693066286	5	leneight ratingfive could you add a new theme "red neon"
3927	1354693066286	5	leneleven ratingfive just like the blue neon (which is great by the way).
3928	1354693066286	5	leneight ratingfive other than that it's an awesome keyboard!
3929	1354692480793	2	lenfive ratingtwo arabic letters are rather small
3930	1354686352617	4	lensixteen ratingfour this is a really convenient app--i was getting super frustrated with my samsung s3s auto type.
3931	1354686352617	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour this saved me so much typing, it remembers your word patterns so that it can even guess whole sentences word by word!
3932	1354686352617	4	lentwentynine ratingfour i love when apps know me, and spell how i spell =) now that i have a tablet, i wish i didn't have to pay extra for that, too.
3933	1354684063384	5	lentwentythree ratingfive best keyboard in the market  it always know what i am going to write next :) but uses good amount of ram in background.
3934	1354683450465	5	lenthree ratingfive very nice keyboard.
3935	1354683450465	5	leneleven ratingfive does a better job than any other keyboard i've tried.
3936	1354678330120	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour it's a decent keyboard replacement but i feel that the famous prediction and correction engine is a little overhyped especially the auto correction part.
3937	1354678330120	4	lenthirteen ratingfour for example typing lowercase free standing "i" isn't auto capitalized, typing "whats"
3938	1354678330120	4	lenten ratingfour isn't auto corrected to "what's" and so on.
3939	1354678330120	4	leneight ratingfour even ics and jb stock keyboards do this.
3940	1354678330120	4	lenseven ratingfour it also takes a lot of memory.
3941	1354676184420	4	leneighteen ratingfour i never buy apps and bc of how great the trial version was i bought the full version.
3942	1354676184420	4	lennine ratingfour sometimes its a bit freaky how predictable this is.
3943	1354676184420	4	lensix ratingfour just wish it had more themes.
3944	1354673024386	3	lennine ratingthree a very good keyboard and the prediction is excellent.
3945	1354673024386	3	lenthirteen ratingthree but frequently it does weird things when trying to type on the web.
3946	1354673024386	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree (dolphin) frequently when entering text in a field it repeats the first key press instead of typing the letters i am pressing.
3947	1354673024386	3	lenfourteen ratingthree it is good but i feel like typing should be flawless on a keyboard.
3948	1354666617688	5	lenthirteen ratingfive best keyboard that u can find, thr personalization on it is just unpredictable!
3949	1354663653032	5	lentwo ratingfive simply superb.
3950	1354663653032	5	lennine ratingfive easy to use and makes typing so much quicker.
3951	1354663653032	5	lenten ratingfive oh, and you can't do this on an iphone!
3952	1354663578324	5	lentwelve ratingfive but i seriously can't wait till swift key flow comes out!
3953	1354662420150	4	leneleven ratingfour not perfect, but i miss it when it's not installed.
3954	1354661616238	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i don't hate typing on my phone as much as i used to.
3955	1354661616238	5	lentwenty ratingfive it would be nice if it had some options to take advantage of the huge screens that are coming out.
3956	1354660362030	5	lensix ratingfive this is my personal favorite keyboard.
3957	1354660362030	5	lenfour ratingfive the prediction is amazing.
3958	1354659947527	5	lenfour ratingfive simply the best keyboard.
3959	1354658744172	4	lentwentythree ratingfour good but please have a save to see card option i payed 4 bucks for this and i takes up a lot of space.
3960	1354830668931	5	lenseven ratingfive much better than the standard samsung keyboard!
3961	1354830668931	5	lennine ratingfive predictive text works a lot better and more efficiently.
3962	1354826782810	5	lenten ratingfive best keyboard i've used, and it learns super fast!
3963	1354826782810	5	leneighteen ratingfive i also like the fact that it includes arrows for easy navigation through the text i've typed.
3964	1354826782810	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i had heard good things about it from other people, but it has been waaaay better than i expected it to be.
3965	1354825801178	4	lentwelve ratingfour i have a galaxy note and the swiping feature doesn't work.
3966	1354825358513	5	leneight ratingfive tried it, liked it, bought it, love it.
3967	1354823785303	2	leneight ratingtwo love the keyboard but its really slow now
3968	1354821189997	5	lenten ratingfive works better than all the other keyboards i've used.
3969	1354821189997	5	lenseven ratingfive i'm now using the flow beta.
3970	1354820259405	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i bought this app last night and i've already bought it for two friends.
3971	1354820259405	5	lenten ratingfive as others have said, the predictive text is amazingly accurate.
3972	1354820259405	5	lenten ratingfive before using swiftkey 3, i cursed the "auto-text / auto-speller"
3973	1354820259405	5	lensix ratingfive on every phone i've owned.
3974	1354820259405	5	lentwelve ratingfive also, the shortcuts for entering punctuation and emoticons are big time-savers.
3975	1354820259405	5	lenthirteen ratingfive and so far, the voice-to-text feature has been just as great.
3976	1354820259405	5	leneight ratingfive maybe the best $4 i've spent in years.
3977	1354816997980	5	lennine ratingfive no other keyboard even comes close to this one.
3978	1354816925162	5	lenfourteen ratingfive tried living without it for a few days, but i gotta have it back.
3979	1354816925162	5	lenseven ratingfive personally, its thebest keyboard in the market!
3980	1354816925162	5	lensix ratingfive keep up th good work devs!
3981	1354816504171	5	lennine ratingfive easily one of the best keyboards i've used!
3982	1354810907061	2	lenfour ratingtwo needs another simultaneous dictionary.
3983	1354810907061	2	lentwo ratingtwo annoying censorship.
3984	1354810907061	2	leneleven ratingtwo i can understand censoring explicit swearing but words like "gay", "horny"
3985	1354810907061	2	lenfive ratingtwo get changed into something else.
3986	1354810907061	2	lenfive ratingtwo gets go changed into "election"
3987	1354810907061	2	lenseven ratingtwo although the letters aren't even near.
3988	1354810907061	2	lensix ratingtwo also, apparently, dictionaries not too complete.
3989	1354810907061	2	lensix ratingtwo writing in portuguese is a pain.
3990	1354810406425	4	lensix ratingfour can't wait for swiftkey flow.
3991	1354810406425	4	lentwelve ratingfour swype typing is coming and from this developer it'll be great
3992	1354810328963	1	lenten ratingone i paid 4$ for this app less then a month ago.
3993	1354810328963	1	lensix ratingone they should refund people's money.
3994	1354810328963	1	lentwelve ratingone 25 cent sell, slap in the face to all that paid full price.
3995	1354810328963	1	lenthirteen ratingone since the update when i type, it puts random periods and wrong text.
3996	1354810236530	5	lennine ratingfive this app makes testing fun and not a hassle.
3997	1354810236530	5	lensixteen ratingfive the app appears to be reading my mind about the next words i want to type.
3998	1354809594689	1	lentwentyfive ratingone i had this the editor's choice version of this app installed on the samsung galaxy note i717 running ice cream sandwich and it worked beautifully.
3999	1354809594689	1	lennine ratingone yesterday i bought the samsung galaxy note ii (sgh-1317).
4000	1354809594689	1	lentwentyone ratingone i have tried installing and uninstalling this app on my new phone since i bought it yesterday afternoon with no luck.
4001	1354809594689	1	lenthirtythree ratingone i get an error message when i try to install the language pack that says there is a problem with the network connection, make sure your network connection is working, then try again.
4002	1354809594689	1	leneight ratingone however, my network connection is working just fine.
4003	1354809594689	1	lentwentythree ratingone i tried every app on the phone that requires a network connection to see if there was a problem on any other app.
4004	1354809594689	1	lenten ratingone i even tried watching an episode of something on netflix.
4005	1354809594689	1	lennineteen ratingone when i had this app installed on my samsung galaxy note i717, i would easily have given it five stars.
4006	1354809594689	1	lenseventeen ratingone i think the problem may be that this new version of the note is running jelly bean.
4007	1354809594689	1	lennine ratingone i hope the problem will be fixed very soon.
4008	1354809594689	1	lentwelve ratingone i see that some others running jelly bean are also experiencing problems.
4009	1354809594689	1	lenfive ratingone swiftkey, please comment or advise.
4010	1354809353858	5	lenthirteen ratingfive you're a very good app swiftkey, but i had to uninstall you.
4011	1354809353858	5	lenseven ratingfive i'm leaving you for swiftkey flow!
4012	1354807659980	5	leneight ratingfive quite simply the fastest and best keyboard available
4013	1354807622071	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive was sceptical that this new keyboard could do anything that my stock keyboard couldn't and the price tag did not help.
4014	1354807622071	5	lensixteen ratingfive i am quite surprised at this app, well pleased and 100x better than the stock android keyboard.
4015	1354806454189	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive this is a great keyboard though i hope they make people who brought this upgrade to swift key flow for free since i'm now using the beta version and i am loving it now.
4016	1354806230542	1	lennine ratingone if got chinese input i will give you 5 star.
4017	1354806230542	1	lenfive ratingone hope faster get chinese input!
4018	1354806230542	1	lenfour ratingone were need chinese input!
4019	1354805838682	5	lenfortytwo ratingfive i am crap at spelling and grammar and this does it all for me is learning how i speak in txt and my txt, emails are getting faster and faster this app is the dogs bollocks and worth every penny and more
4020	1354805180444	5	lenfourteen ratingfive just tried out the beta flow version of this app and i am pleased.
4021	1354805180444	5	lenten ratingfive can't wait for it to come out of beta.
4022	1354805180444	5	lentwelve ratingfive gonna be the best keyboard in the play store without a doubt
4023	1354801900539	5	lennine ratingfive great app, much better keyboard than samsung's effort.
4024	1354801900539	5	lenseventeen ratingfive it's like an improved keyboard from my old htc desire, which was hard to fault anyway.
4025	1354801900539	5	lentwentyone ratingfive had a little trouble upgrading from the trial but i got a swift response (5 minutes!) in my email which sorted everything.
4026	1354801900539	5	lenthree ratingfive 5 stars well deserved.
4027	1354798610922	5	lenfive ratingfive cool its a great app
4028	1354797589776	5	lennine ratingfive normal typing just doesn't cut it any more.
4029	1354797589776	5	lenseventeen ratingfive when i return to my desktop, ios devices, anything else, i want the auto-completion swiftkey provides.
4030	1354797589776	5	lenfortyone ratingfive normally i would give it only four stars because there are still a few very minor bugs that need ironing out from a power user perspective, but this app is one of the key selling points for android, in my opinion.
4031	1354794574753	3	lentwelve ratingthree why is the smiley face button more important than the enter button?
4032	1354794574753	3	lentwentyseven ratingthree with a keyboard that's supposed to be fast and cater to the user it makes no sense as to why this shouldn't be an option.
4033	1354794574753	3	lenfive ratingthree it's elementary and ridiculous.
4034	1354794071826	1	leneight ratingone why does it learn from everything except whatsapp?
4035	1354793229268	3	lenfive ratingthree used to be 5 star earlier.
4036	1354793229268	3	lenseventeen ratingthree but now that i use voice input, there is no easy way of inserting a full stop.
4037	1354793229268	3	lenfourteen ratingthree google voice input enters al words correctly but hardly inserts any fullstop or comma.
4038	1354793229268	3	lentwentynine ratingthree add a feature so that while talking to the mobile, there is another button beside the mic icon to insert a fullstop and you willl get your 5 stars back!
4039	1354916507660	5	lenthirteen ratingfive one of those apps you just install when you get a new device.
4040	1354916200862	5	lenten ratingfive or please add a way to customize your own theme.
4041	1354915956211	5	lensixteen ratingfive i've had it for 20 minutes and i already love it, can't wait for flow!
4042	1354912676994	4	lensix ratingfour swiftkey is really a good keyboard.
4043	1354912676994	4	lentwelve ratingfour but not perfect for me, hope can improve by adding chinese language.
4044	1354912676994	4	lenten ratingfour besides, slide to delete not so sensitive, hope can improve
4045	1354912326735	5	lenseven ratingfive now after this update, swiftkey deserve 5 stars
4046	1354905208263	5	lenfour ratingfive updated to jelly bean.
4047	1354905208263	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i have all haptic feedback turned off on my phone, but after the update it has been turned back on only using swiftkey.
4048	1354905208263	5	lenfive ratingfive it's draining my battery.
4049	1354905208263	5	lensix ratingfive please fix asap, love this keyboard!
4050	1354904611295	1	leneleven ratingone my phone stoped responding while using the keyboard seince recent update.
4051	1354904611295	1	lenfour ratingone i switched to anysoftkeyboard.
4052	1354903496395	5	lenten ratingfive keyboard on android ;-)  just improve the polish and french dict. :-)
4053	1354903325395	4	lentwentythree ratingfour this keyboard was stunning on my old galaxy ace2 but i now use galaxy s3 mini running jelly bean 4.1 and now swiftkey will not work.
4054	1354903325395	4	lenthirtytwo ratingfour the keyboard refuses to pop-up when i require to type ( in all apps including txt, kingsoft office, whatsapp log-in's etc) and i hve to revert to the samsung keyboard.
4055	1354903325395	4	lenfive ratingfour regretably had to un-install.
4056	1354902565715	5	leneight ratingfive buy this app five stars worth every penny.
4057	1354902565715	5	lenfour ratingfive super easy and simple.
4058	1354902288049	5	lensixteen ratingfive this is my favorite app and it works very well with the exception of one thing.
4059	1354902288049	5	lenthirteen ratingfive the swipe down gesture to minimize the keyboard doesn't work very well.
4060	1354902288049	5	lensixteen ratingfive i just installed swiftkey flow beta and it also works swimmingly but with the same caveat.
4061	1354902040299	5	leneight ratingfive now this is what you call an app.
4062	1354902040299	5	leneight ratingfive fantastic,have made my life heck lot easier.
4063	1354902040299	5	lenthirteen ratingfive typing was never so easy nor fun, but thank to developer, it is.
4064	1354902040299	5	lennine ratingfive messaging, email, chatting they all are so good now.
4065	1354902040299	5	lenfifteen ratingfive would recommend it to everybody, jus buy and leave that one pizza for a day.
4066	1354902040299	5	lenfour ratingfive u won't regret.
4067	1354902040299	5	lentwelve ratingfive a request to google, please incorporate this in the next android update.
4068	1354901012563	5	lenfourteen ratingfive if there's only one app you need to buy, this is definitely it.
4069	1354900305872	3	leneighteen ratingthree so, i downloaded the trial app and fell in love with this setup over my factory siii keyboard.
4070	1354900305872	3	leneleven ratingthree i used until trial period ran out, then purchased the app.
4071	1354900305872	3	lentwentyseven ratingthree now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up at all and it seems like words are being put in that i never was attempting to write.
4072	1354900305872	3	lentwentyfive ratingthree also, i am not too fond of the fact that when i do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
4073	1354900305872	3	leneight ratingthree downloaded to make life easier, not so much.
4074	1354900273098	5	lenfour ratingfive we need more themes!
4075	1354900273098	5	leneight ratingfive like a red and green one for christmas!
4076	1354900273098	5	lenthree ratingfive or color personalization
4077	1354899742704	5	lennine ratingfive have been using it for the past one year.
4078	1354899742704	5	lenthirteen ratingfive the latest version, makes it the best keyboard in the market right now.
4079	1354899742704	5	leneleven ratingfive proven again why you chaps are the best in the market.
4080	1354899742704	5	leneight ratingfive typing with pleasure, should be your new motto.
4081	1354899742704	5	lenthree ratingfive great work guys.
4082	1354895343509	5	lenthree ratingfive best keyboard app
4083	1354894792070	5	lentwenty ratingfive this keyboard just keeps getting better and better, if you are debating the purchase, i can't recommend this enough.
4084	1354894792070	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive it has the most customization compared to any of the other ones i have tried (swift, stock, hackers.) well worth whatever price they are asking.
4085	1354892598040	2	leneight ratingtwo .but after last update it's total crap!
4086	1354892598040	2	leneighteen ratingtwo i'm using croatian layout and we used to have croatian letters underneath regular i.e. long press.
4087	1354892598040	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo now there are 5 croatian letters at most right making all keys unbelievably tiny!
4088	1354892598040	2	lennine ratingtwo and i don't want to type in landscape.
4089	1354892598040	2	lenseventeen ratingtwo if you can't fix this (that ? is under c, ? is under z, etc) please refund me.
4090	1354892598040	2	lentwelve ratingtwo i'm sorry for one star, but this is completely your fault.
4091	1354892039002	1	lenten ratingone autocorrect no longer works since they put out swiftkey flow.
4092	1354892039002	1	lensix ratingone even in this version without flow.
4093	1354892039002	1	lensix ratingone now this app becomes completely useless.
4094	1354891084453	5	lenfour ratingfive first, flow is amazing.
4095	1354891084453	5	lentwo ratingfive great job.
4096	1354891084453	5	leneighteen ratingfive one thing i'm confused on how to do is write words like 'too' using the flow method.
4097	1354891084453	5	leneleven ratingfive every time i try it comes out with only one 'o'.
4098	1354891084453	5	lentwenty ratingfive i've tried moving my finger in circles on the o key but i can't get it to work.
4099	1354891084453	5	leneight ratingfive anyone found a way to solve this problem?
4100	1354891084453	5	lennine ratingfive its really annoying and it's my only complaint!
4101	1354890969072	5	lenten ratingfive been using this keyboard for ages, best keyboard on android.
4102	1354890969072	5	lenfortyone ratingfive have noticed a bug with it though (although not sure if this is a bug with the keyboard or with android), whenever my phone runs out of battery or i restart it for any reason, the keyboard defaults to samsung keyboard.
4103	1354890969072	5	lenfour ratingfive galaxy s3 running jelly bean
4104	1354890152962	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i was skeptical that this could learn from previous texts,  but it really does.
4105	1354890152962	5	lenthirteen ratingfive even silly terms that i use with family members are picked up on.
4106	1354888768140	5	lenseventeen ratingfive great replacement to the stock keyboard, love the predictions it saves a lot of typing for me.
4107	1354887348444	5	lensix ratingfive i would kill for this keyboard.
4108	1354887348444	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this is simply the best keyboard on android, and the new flow is even better.
4109	1354884301305	1	leneight ratingone after turning on phone keyboard does not load.
4110	1354884301305	1	leneight ratingone have to go into settings and choose again.
4111	1354884221230	5	lenseventeen ratingfive the default keyboard on my phone is alright, but a friend told me to try this out.
4112	1354884221230	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive it is much better than the standard keyboard on my xperia s. the auto correct is a god send and the predictions can make some pretty good sentences.
4113	1354884221230	5	lennine ratingfive worth the small price tag for a great app.
4114	1354879513236	5	lentwelve ratingfive don't think i can ever use another on screen keyboard again
4115	1354876034112	3	lensix ratingthree it misses the hinglish language support.
4116	1354876034112	3	lenthirteen ratingthree it auto corrects when i think it should have already learnt a word.
4117	1354870867100	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive it still lags on viber but over all it is amazing but yeah when is swiftkey flow coming to this app or making a new one the is the flow version?
4118	1354870307316	5	lenten ratingfive i was a droid 2 global user, because of the "real"
4119	1354870307316	5	lensix ratingfive and switched to a virtual one.
4120	1354870307316	5	lenfourteen ratingfive it was terrible, as i have big thumbs, and kept typing the wrong letters.
4121	1354870307316	5	lenfive ratingfive swiftkey saved my cellphone experience!
4122	1354869392954	5	lennine ratingfive this is the absolute best keyboard i've tried!
4123	1354868189658	4	lenfifteen ratingfour the only thing stopping this keyboard being the perfect android keyboard are these two issues.
4124	1354868189658	4	lensix ratingfour issue 1: i don't use smileys!
4125	1354868189658	4	lentwenty ratingfour please give me the option to have a persistent enter key, instead of the smiley key forced by some apps.
4126	1354868189658	4	lenfour ratingfour issue 2: alt keys layout.
4127	1354868189658	4	lenfourteen ratingfour couldn't you just set it out like every other keyboard on the market!?
4128	1354868189658	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour i want my numbers where they are shown on the main screen,  i want my alt keys where they are shown on the main screen.
4129	1354868189658	4	leneight ratingfour at least give the option to your users.
4130	1354867196706	5	leneight ratingfive tried it, liked it, bought it, love it.
4131	1354867041198	5	lenten ratingfive it's like i never gave up my full keyboard
4132	1354866520383	5	lentwo ratingfive simply amazing!
4133	1354862964164	3	lentwentyone ratingthree this keyboard is amazing for english but it doesn't have a japanese option so it's very inconvenient for me.
4134	1354860517277	4	lentwelve ratingfour it's a great keyboard, and the upcoming flow option is great!
4135	1354860517277	4	lenten ratingfour the only 'complaint' is that the themes are quite awful.
4136	1354860517277	4	lennine ratingfour not the worst or unbearable, but just not great.
4137	1354860517277	4	leneleven ratingfour the flow line looks very nice, almost looks out of place
4138	1354860072884	5	lenfourteen ratingfive ok so i'm an avid swype guy but love swiftkey's predictive text.
4139	1354860072884	5	lenseven ratingfive the beta of flow is truly brilliant.
4140	1354860072884	5	lentwo ratingfive sorry swype.
4141	1354859584322	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive being able to mix multiple languages so easily together with the great and accurate predictions makes this my favourite app on android, hands down.
4142	1354859584322	5	lensix ratingfive keep up the great work guys!
4143	1354857541328	5	lentwo ratingfive amazing application.
4144	1354857479683	5	lennine ratingfive the very best keyboard app i've ever used
4145	1354856744100	1	lenten ratingone when i'm on facebook i only get the keyboard.
4146	1354856744100	1	lenseven ratingone no auto correct or word - guess - er.
4147	1354856744100	1	lennineteen ratingone also when i finish a word at the end of a line i can't insert a space bar?
4148	1354856230117	5	leneight ratingfive this is an excellent choice for a keyboard.
4149	1354856230117	5	lentwo ratingfive thanks swiftkey
4150	1354855212140	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i love this apps,  it's a good keyboard app but i strongly request for the chinese input cause ii use it a lot.
4151	1354853778502	4	lenseven ratingfour not going to lie, should be 5 stars.
4152	1354853778502	4	lenfifteen ratingfour slow to minimize on jb maxx hd update, the functionality however destroys ics/jb keyboard.
4153	1354850930755	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this app my texts have immediately improved i am amazed by the word predictions.
4154	1354850930755	5	lenfive ratingfive i was a iphone user.
4155	1354850930755	5	lenten ratingfive in the past two weeks i've could easily switch!
4156	1354849304933	5	lenseven ratingfive worth every penny when the trial ended!
4157	1354849304933	5	lentwentyone ratingfive prediction is the best and does not try to correct most text lingo when you need a message to be short!
4158	1354846937898	5	lenthree ratingfive best keyboard, period.
4159	1354845420857	5	lentwelve ratingfive awesome keyboard i don't think that there is a better keyboard.
4160	1354845293945	5	lensixteen ratingfive just downloaded swiftkey flow beta as i've use and loved swiftkey for a long time.
4161	1354845293945	5	lenfive ratingfive it's swype for swiftkey.
4162	1354845293945	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i was never into swiping until armando on youtube used it in his android tutorials.
4163	1354845293945	5	leneight ratingfive picked this up and i'm in love.
4164	1354845293945	5	lennine ratingfive i love swiftkey and i definitely love swiftkey flow!
4165	1354845293945	5	lentwo ratingfive great app.
4166	1354845199763	5	lenfive ratingfive the flow beta is fantastic!
4167	1354845199763	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i'm typing five times as fast as normal with barely any mistakes.
4168	1354845199763	5	lenthree ratingfive great job guys!
4169	1354842683687	4	leneleven ratingfour awesome keyboard needs more haptic feedback and it will be perfect.
4170	1354842017954	5	lenthirteen ratingfive waiting for chinese support, it's amazing to try this kind of input.
4171	1354841927616	5	lentwo ratingfive great app
4172	1354839881371	5	lenthree ratingfive best keyboard available.
4173	1354839881371	5	leneight ratingfive love the new swipe feature in the beta!
4174	1354839881371	5	lentwo ratingfive constantly improving.
4175	1354837688947	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive the default samsung galaxy s3 keyboard was driving me crazy - i was making tons of typos everywhere, much more so than when i had an iphone.
4176	1354837688947	5	lenten ratingfive since switching to swiftkey 3, all those typos are history \o/
4177	1354837650863	4	leneight ratingfour it makes typing so much easier to type.
4178	1354837650863	4	lenthirteen ratingfour it would be more awesome if they would add a screen shot key.
4179	1354837650863	4	lennine ratingfour i haven't seen any keyboards with that yet.
4180	1354835981996	4	leneleven ratingfour my girlfriend is taiwanese and she uses my phone a lot.
4181	1354835981996	4	lenfive ratingfour can you add traditional chinese?
4182	1354835486889	5	lenfourteen ratingfive love swift key best keyboard i've ever used and i've tried tons!
4183	1354835486889	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive took a bit to get used to the slider but i don't even notice anymore and love the new pink theme!.
4184	1354835486889	5	lenfourteen ratingfive the keyboard is now running slow, freezes  takes a while to open and close.
4185	1354834870428	5	lenfour ratingfive freakishly accurate at times.
4186	1354834870428	5	lentwelve ratingfive i'm really looking to the flow update to go with it.
4187	1354833902121	5	lentwo ratingfive great app.
4188	1354833902121	5	lensix ratingfive way better than the default keyboard
4189	1354833064532	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i love everything about the app except for one thing, i wish there were more theme options.
4190	1354816373600	1	lenfiftyone ratingone t h i s a p p l i c a t i o n m a k e s m y t e x t s s e n d l i k e t h i s.  when i changed it back to the samsung galaxy keyboard it stopped.
4191	1354816373600	1	lenfive ratingone i paid for this app.
4192	1354816373600	1	lennine ratingone i would give it negative stars if i could
4193	1354816352492	5	lenfive ratingfive this is an amazing app.
4194	1354816352492	5	lentwelve ratingfive i am now writing my books on my phone because of this.
4195	1354815496004	4	lenseven ratingfour i can type so much faster now.
4196	1354815496004	4	lenthirteen ratingfour the only complaint is have is that there isn't a customized dictionary.
4197	1354815496004	4	lenten ratingfour it doesn't predict words i use all the time
4198	1354814853953	5	lentwenty ratingfive i was skeptical at first but this is by far the fastest and most accurate keyboard i have ever used.
4199	1354814853953	5	lennine ratingfive i wish i would have bought this long ago.
4200	1354814853953	5	lenfive ratingfive the prediction is spot on.
4201	1354814853953	5	lensix ratingfive using an epic 4g touch with ics
4202	1354814558565	1	lenten ratingone pls update thai language im waiting for the long time
4203	1354813215922	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i came from an ios background and dealt with that horrendous typing experience for years.
4204	1354813215922	5	lenfourteen ratingfive then i got an android phone, and i was impressed with the stock keyboard.
4205	1354813215922	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this, however, blows stock out of the water and into the frying pan.
4206	1354813215922	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive the word suggestions are by far the best feature (and it actually works, unlike autocorrect) but being able to long-tap for extra characters is really useful too.
4207	1354812834136	5	lentwo ratingfive truly awesome.
4208	1354812770652	4	lenseven ratingfour by far the best keyboard on android.
4209	1354812770652	4	lentwelve ratingfour i deducted one star, however, because it causes crashes with some regularity.
4210	1354812389581	5	lenthree ratingfive love this keyboard.
4211	1354812389581	5	lenten ratingfive google needs to put in a bid for this company.
4212	1354812389581	5	lenseven ratingfive seriously, make this a permanent android feature.
4213	1354811234067	5	lenthree ratingfive love this keyboard.
4214	1354811234067	5	leneleven ratingfive it's saved me over 100,000 keystrokes since installation earlier this year.
4215	1354811234067	5	lenthree ratingfive highly recommend this.
4216	1354791542622	5	lennine ratingfive so i downloaded and bought swiftkey3 and i love it.
4217	1354791542622	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i just downloaded swift key flow and it is amazing if it gets good reviews and can buy it i highly recommend you do
4218	1354788923608	5	lentwelve ratingfive the keyboard sometimes have a lag when typing, especially on number pad.
4219	1354788923608	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive other thing is that the layout is confusing when you need to quickly use symbol, i like my s3 stock keyboard layout more.
4220	1354788923608	5	lenfour ratingfive anything else is ok.
4221	1354788055960	5	leneight ratingfive worth the low price and i'm cheap
4222	1354784499525	3	lenthirteen ratingthree back to 3 stars until they add an option to disable the key popup !
4223	1354777827811	4	lenfive ratingfour best keyboard out there imo.
4224	1354777827811	4	leneight ratingfour my only slight annoyance is when the ".com"
4225	1354777827811	4	lentwo ratingfour key appears.
4226	1354777827811	4	lenseventeen ratingfour i wish there was an option to hide it, i seem to press it on accident often.
4227	1354777827811	4	lenfourteen ratingfour also, why does swiftkey continually give me a notification for choosing the default keyboard?
4228	1354774575429	1	lenfourteen ratingone after upgrading to jelly bean, this app had stop working, language pack  download failed.
4229	1354766576870	4	lenthirtyfour ratingfour i purchased this app because it simply awesome but after i movedto jellybean it'sshowing error crashes and copy and paste optionsare disabled.please let me know the solution if any one have any.
4230	1354766044363	1	leneleven ratingone used to be the best - now stock us better and quicker.
4231	1354765214644	5	lennine ratingfive it's actually the best keyboard currently for android.
4232	1354764784395	5	lentwo ratingfive more themes.?
4233	1354760716406	3	lenfourteen ratingthree works perfect but for some reason it lags when i exit the typing mode.
4234	1354760191423	5	lenseven ratingfive much much better than the original keyboard.
4235	1354760191423	5	lensixteen ratingfive i can completely misspell a word and it figure out what it's supposed to be.
4236	1354758497059	3	lenthirty ratingthree just updated my at&t galaxy s3 from os 4.0.4 to the new 4.1.1 jelly bean and my paid version of swift key 3 no longer works and keeps force closing fix this please?
4237	1354758497059	3	lennine ratingthree i'll gice it 5 star's when works again.
4238	1354758112051	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this is hands down the greatest keyboard on a phone iv ever used.
4239	1354758112051	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive only thing is that if you screw up the last word of a text message and hit send it doesn't fix that last word before sending.
4240	1354758112051	5	lentwentythree ratingfive please make it fix the last word when we hit send. otherwise i'm never typing wth anything else ever again haha cheers.
4241	1354756809088	4	lenthirteen ratingfour could use an update for better keys on 7 inch tablets  like my nexus 7
4242	1354754843351	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo im one of those people who depend on auto correct and it never works.
4243	1354750278276	5	lenfifteen ratingfive at first, i had a difficult time in learning about, how to type with this.
4244	1354750278276	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive but after going through with the settings, i saw that there is an option to let this software read through my sms', emails', tweets' content, and identify patterns.
4245	1354750278276	5	lenthirteen ratingfive now i don't have to type, 'honey,  i'm on my way'.
4246	1354750278276	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i just have to type, hon and honey with capital letters h appears.
4247	1354750278276	5	lenthirtyfour ratingfive i just have to tap on it, and one by one other wordings of i'm on my way home appears, and all i have to do then is, tap on each of them.
4248	1354747557097	5	lensixteen ratingfive no longer will i be making ridiculous typos like in the title of the this review!
4249	1354747557097	5	lenthirteen ratingfive only been using this app for a day but i'm very impressed!
4250	1354747557097	5	leneighteen ratingfive i've never typed so fast on a phone before and i've got a lot of practice!
4251	1354747557097	5	lensix ratingfive wish i had bought this earlier!
4252	1354747151004	3	lenfour ratingthree good keyboard but ''percentage''
4253	1354747151004	3	lenseven ratingthree symbol missing and not very good performance.
4254	1354747151004	3	lenthree ratingthree feels sluggish sometimes.
4255	1354746944442	1	leneight ratingone holy hwll this is more annoying than anything.
4256	1354746944442	1	lentwenty ratingone thanks forbalways adding words when i hit the space bar and for always learning the wrong way to spell words.
4257	1354745748867	5	lenseven ratingfive by far the best keyboard app ever!
4258	1355001836268	4	lennineteen ratingfour i request developers to add the support for training the keyboard through whatsapp similar to twitter, google and facebook.
4259	1354998833313	3	lentwenty ratingthree i can see this working for some people, but i couldnt type for the life of me on this keyboard.
4260	1354998833313	3	lentwentyfour ratingthree just switched from an iphone 4s, so it may just take getting used to, but i have zero issues witht the standard android keyboard fwiw.
4261	1354998833313	3	lensix ratingthree suggested words were never accurate either.
4262	1354998833313	3	lenfour ratingthree overall just kinda meh
4263	1354992897221	4	lensixteen ratingfour it's good but i'm only going it 4 stars because it doesn't have swype.
4264	1354992897221	4	lennine ratingfour that's a feature i use all the time.
4265	1354992254207	5	lenfive ratingfive the best typing experience ever.
4266	1354988119037	5	lensix ratingfive i sell phones for a living.
4267	1354988119037	5	lenthirty ratingfive and i've told every and any customer that comes in and just isn't sure about a certain phone because of having issues with texting accuracy about swiftkey keyboard.
4268	1354988119037	5	lenfortytwo ratingfive my only issue with this and it's a serious issue with me is that since i got the update for my s iii to 4.1 is that i can not find out how to turn off the haptic feedback when i type.
4269	1354988119037	5	lentwentyone ratingfive the phone's settings have it turned off but no matter what i do to try and troubleshoot it, nothing works.
4270	1354988119037	5	lenfive ratingfive a response would be apprecia
4271	1354983233592	4	lenfour ratingfour would love more themes!
4272	1354982838744	3	lenfifteen ratingthree but, it's been almost a year and i think one new theme was added!
4273	1354982838744	3	lensix ratingthree get on board the theme wagon!
4274	1354982838744	3	leneight ratingthree uninstalled although i bought it a year ago.
4275	1354977175069	5	lentwelve ratingfive would like to see manual selection between languages instead of auto detection.
4276	1354976385758	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive this by far the best keyboard out there, but with my recent update to jb, its kinda laggy and not so functional.
4277	1354975014007	5	lentwentythree ratingfive simply the best, the app's engine is simply amazing, can't wait for the next update with the included new flow feature :)
4278	1354974725427	3	lentwenty ratingthree as mentioned by others, google search has slowed with the keyboard not appearing for several seconds when using this keyboard.
4279	1354974725427	3	lenfour ratingthree otherwise a great app.
4280	1354967400620	5	lentwentynine ratingfive i have had this keyboard since i first got the evo, i just love it, i wish it allowed me to input emojis but it is still a 5star app!
4281	1354964003370	5	lenseven ratingfive very efficient, best keyboard app out there.
4282	1354964003370	5	lenfour ratingfive well worth the money.
4283	1354960822746	4	lenthirteen ratingfour so happy i found this app and then purchased it while on sale.
4284	1354960822746	4	lensix ratingfour way better than the stock gs3 keyboard.
4285	1354960822746	4	lentwelve ratingfour swiftkey please add: swipe, personal dictionary and prediction for email and name.
4286	1354955745997	1	lenfive ratingone not working with jelly bean
4287	1354953220264	5	leneleven ratingfive probably the best app i have ever bought, android or ois.
4288	1354953220264	5	leneleven ratingfive i generate whole texts with only ever pushing a few keys.
4289	1354953220264	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive intuitive responses that are so accurate, it makes me question if this app is actually programmed using black magic and virgin sacrifices.
4290	1354950202016	5	lenfourteen ratingfive gave the trial a go and found it far superior to the stock app.
4291	1354950202016	5	lenseven ratingfive so i bought it, brilliant and intuitive.
4292	1354946711194	4	lennine ratingfour this is a great improvement on the android keyboard.
4293	1354946711194	4	lenfourteen ratingfour some of the predictive text functions are annoying but its a good app otherwise.
4294	1354945980843	5	lenfive ratingfive i really love this keyboard!
4295	1354945980843	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive i was a little hesitant about purchasing a keyboard to replace the stock keyboard in my samsung galaxy s iii, but i am really glad i did!
4296	1354944587183	5	lennine ratingfive this the best virtual keyboard in the android world!
4297	1354942982583	4	lenfourteen ratingfour pleeeaassseee come out with more themes.i'm kinda bored with the current ones :)
4298	1354939919305	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i'd still like an editable dictionary of the words that it has learned.
4299	1354936807451	5	leneleven ratingfive by far the best typing app on the market hands down!
4300	1354936807451	5	lenthirteen ratingfive you will never use anything else once you start to use this app.
4301	1354936203104	5	lentwentysix ratingfive ahora con teclado en espa?ol, muy practico y el ajuste de todas las letras es grandioso, pienso que no hay otro que se le compare.
4302	1354936203104	5	lenseven ratingfive anda de maravilla con cm10 gracias a quarx.
4303	1354936203104	5	lenthirteen ratingfive felicidades el mejor de todos y no hay discusi¨®n. gracias por swiftkey flow, est¨¢ grandioso.
4304	1354935539365	2	lentwo ratingtwo app sucks.
4305	1354935539365	2	lenfour ratingtwo closes while i type.
4306	1354935539365	2	lennineteen ratingtwo puts in wrong words when i have the right words and completely omits words when i type too fast.
4307	1354935539365	2	leneleven ratingtwo only thing good thing about it is the custom color options.
4308	1354935539365	2	lenfour ratingtwo motorola photon keyboard better.
4309	1354935539365	2	leneleven ratingtwo oh and the voice recognition of voice to text barely works.
4310	1354935539365	2	lennine ratingtwo had to switch to photon keyboard to use it.
4311	1354934289549	4	lenten ratingfour after updating to jb, there is no heptic intensity control.
4312	1354933588818	5	lenfive ratingfive really happy with this keyboard!
4313	1354933426644	5	lentwenty ratingfive but i don't like keyboard skin model, if you can make keyboard skin like original keyboard, itu will great
4314	1354927666424	2	lentwo ratingtwo wayyyy better.
4315	1354925459449	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommended.
4316	1354925459449	5	lenfourteen ratingfive give it a little while and it can reduce your typing by a lot.
4317	1354925001851	5	lentwentysix ratingfive n? som jeg jeg har brukt tastaturet i over ett ?r har swiftkey virkelig l?rt seg mitt tappem?nster og mine standard fraser og svar.
4318	1354925001851	5	lensix ratingfive kan skrive meldinger utrolig kjapt n?.
4319	1354922354968	3	lenthirty ratingthree just updated my at&t galaxy s3 from os 4.0.4 to the new 4.1.1 jelly bean and my paid version of swift key 3 no longer works and keeps force closing fix this please?
4320	1354922354968	3	lennine ratingthree i'll gice it 5 star's when works again.
4321	1354920575534	5	lenten ratingfive really good keyboard & excellent predictive & autocorrect engine with this app!
4322	1354920575534	5	lenten ratingfive much more intuitive than the standard android keyboard & /or swype!
4323	1354920575534	5	lensix ratingfive hooked after just a few days!
4324	1354919758406	5	lenfortyeight ratingfive if you just make it possible to sync user dictionary with google drive so we can have it with multiple devices (that will let you have the new words you typed in all of your devices) and don't lose them if you wipe or change the device.
4325	1354919758406	5	lenfifteen ratingfive syncing will be great in background with every time the keyboard shows up and disappears.
4326	1355090065829	5	lenten ratingfive it makes typing a lot easier great app very satisfied :)
4327	1355089658784	5	leneleven ratingfive i never rate an app but this one i had to!
4328	1355089658784	5	lentwentythree ratingfive the way its laid out is perfect and its the only keyboard iv found that has the numbers set up like a10 key pad.
4329	1355089658784	5	lenfour ratingfive kudos to the developer!
4330	1355089146797	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo sk3 was working flawlessly until the at&t jb update for s3 recently came out.
4331	1355089146797	2	lentwentysix ratingtwo when locking the screen while having the text field open and the keyboard out and then unlocking the phone, the text field rewrites itself and resizes.
4332	1355089146797	2	lenseven ratingtwo small issue, but annoying none the less.
4333	1355089146797	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo also, there is lag in the keyboard processes when sending and receiving messages.
4334	1355089146797	2	lenfive ratingtwo overall, great product for ics.
4335	1355089146797	2	leneleven ratingtwo will return to give 5 stars once jb update issues are resolved.
4336	1355088613601	3	lentwentyseven ratingthree i really like this keyboard it corrects spelling brilliantly the customisation is great though i think there could be a lot of things done to improve it.
4337	1355088613601	3	lensixteen ratingthree i would like to see the numbers separately above the the first row of the keys.
4338	1355088613601	3	lentwenty ratingthree and when on land scape mode it takes up the whole screen and will not show you the text screen.
4339	1355088613601	3	leneleven ratingthree though apart from these few annoyances it works flush and fulid.
4340	1355088613601	3	lensix ratingthree thanks alot guys worth the money.
4341	1355088613601	3	leneight ratingthree (i am comparing it to the samsung note 2)
4342	1355088599311	5	lennine ratingfive glad i got the paid version of this app.
4343	1355085701388	5	lenseven ratingfive thanks swiftkey 3,youve been great to me.
4344	1355085701388	5	lenseven ratingfive moving up to your brother, swiftkey flow.
4345	1355083524122	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i've had it for a whole but avoided using it because it doesn't matter have the heart symbol like the samsung keyboard.
4346	1355083524122	5	leneight ratingfive but now i think advantages outweigh that part.
4347	1355083524122	5	lenseven ratingfive (i still hope for some hearts :d)
4348	1355083251603	5	lensixteen ratingfive the personalization, along with the word predicting is far better than i thought it would be!
4349	1355080939432	4	lenthirtyeight ratingfour i'm currently using the swiftkey flow beta and i'm having trouble getting in to the site to report could you please help me an email me this was the only way i saw to contact you
4350	1355080260918	5	lenseven ratingfive best keyboard app that was ever created!
4351	1355078527279	5	lenseven ratingfive the predictions keep getting better and better.
4352	1355078527279	5	lenfour ratingfive best keyboard hands down.
4353	1355078077610	5	lenthree ratingfive love this app!
4354	1355078077610	5	lennine ratingfive yous guys should make a pink neon keyboard though
4355	1355077448080	5	lenfive ratingfive i absolutely love this app.
4356	1355077448080	5	lenten ratingfive it has made owning my phone so much more enjoyable.
4357	1355077448080	5	leneight ratingfive seriously, this is the best keyboard out there.
4358	1355077448080	5	lentwelve ratingfive i do wish it supported japanese characters, but otherwise it's perfect.
4359	1355077448080	5	lensix ratingfive i suggest this app to everyone!
4360	1355072712481	4	lenthirteen ratingfour plzzzz i luv swiftkey but no vnmese support is a dealbreaker for me
4361	1355071091775	4	leneighteen ratingfour nice keyboard but even in its new v3 incarnation there's no dedicated voice key, hence losing a star.
4362	1355071091775	4	lennine ratingfour c'mon swiftkey, you need a dedicated voice key!
4363	1355067627196	2	lennineteen ratingtwo it doesn't have a percent symbol, what the hell kind of keyboard doesn't have a percent symbol
4364	1355063481564	2	lensixteen ratingtwo would be awesome if it didn't keep resetting back to its original settings every 5 mins.
4365	1355063313189	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour atm the lowest sound level for the type writer style sound is way too loud, i'd really like a quieter option!
4366	1355061406496	5	lentwo ratingfive great predictions.
4367	1355061406496	5	leneleven ratingfive takes some getting used to but far superior to default keyboard.
4368	1355061406496	5	leneleven ratingfive you don't need to switch languages which is v useful.
4369	1355061406496	5	lenthree ratingfive worth paying for.
4370	1355060842772	5	lennine ratingfive one of the best keyboards in the play store.
4371	1355056347171	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive i rely on this so much because i type quick and make quite a few typo's! i highly recommend this to every android user!
4372	1355056347171	5	lentwenty ratingfive i would be lost without swift key! :-) wish there was some more themes for it like maybe a pink one? :-)
4373	1355053254730	2	lentwentythree ratingtwo used to work brilliantly with previous android versions but the swiftkey auto correct function stopped working after using it with android jelly bean.
4374	1355053254730	2	lenten ratingtwo auto correct was the whole reason why i bought swiftkey.
4375	1355048787315	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree as much as is pains me to say, this app has been the root of a bunch of problems on my phone.
4376	1355048787315	3	leneleven ratingthree crashes and freezing are all too familiar when this is active.
4377	1355043084226	4	lenthree ratingfour awesome prediction capabilities.
4378	1355043084226	4	lenseven ratingfour makes typing incredibly fast and hassle free!
4379	1355043084226	4	lenseven ratingfour but i wish it used less memory!
4380	1355040004834	5	lenfifteen ratingfive tried them all (swype, htc and samsung default, cyanogenmod) and this one tops them all.
4381	1355040004834	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommended.
4382	1355037511356	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive i just got this app to try it out because of all the incredible ratings, and i am astounded by how good it really is!
4383	1355037511356	5	lennine ratingfive easily the best replacement for the terrible galaxy s3 keyboard!
4384	1355034465733	5	leneight ratingfive hands down the best app on google play.
4385	1355034465733	5	lensixteen ratingfive swype wasn't my thing, but i can send texts at lightening speed thanks to swiftkey.
4386	1355034465733	5	leneight ratingfive it's easy to use and works perfectly.
4387	1355032713177	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this app literally saves me so much time when it comes to my typing!
4388	1355032713177	5	lenfive ratingfive definitely recommend this to everyone
4389	1355031265414	5	lenfive ratingfive easy typing with one hand
4390	1355030664761	4	lenfifteen ratingfour there are a few words that are difficult or impossible to type using the flow.
4391	1355030664761	4	lenthirteen ratingfour the word "it's" is almost impossible and always comes out as "is".
4392	1355030664761	4	leneight ratingfour also could you allow use of could words?
4393	1355030640160	5	lenseven ratingfive i changed phones and i missed it.
4394	1355027782465	4	leneight ratingfour please integrate learning from whatsapp messenger as well.
4395	1355022156959	4	lentwentythree ratingfour everything is perfect, but it's missing emoji, a greatly asked for feature since july 2011, once that happens ill upgrade to 5 stars fast!
4396	1355022156959	4	lenfourteen ratingfour with jelly bean's emoji update it can't be that hard can it?
4397	1355022156959	4	lentwentyone ratingfour i'm not asking for the iphone png's but even the jelly bean ones will make a world of difference.
4398	1355022156959	4	lenthirtysix ratingfour at the bottom corner there's an option for the regular smileys while texting but can there be an option to switch those to emoji or even an option to change them to what you want?
4399	1355018959245	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome app!
4400	1355018146658	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i love this app most of the time it perdicts what im gonna say
4401	1355017978934	5	lenfive ratingfive and amazing app for typing.
4402	1355017978934	5	lensixteen ratingfive it gets better as you use it and your typing speed increases as it gets better.
4403	1355017030411	5	lenseven ratingfive sometimes wish it had more themes though.
4404	1355016970762	4	lenfour ratingfour well worth the purchase.
4405	1355016970762	4	lennine ratingfour only snag is the haptic feedback doesn't work.
4406	1355016584189	4	lenfive ratingfour i really like this keyboard.
4407	1355016584189	4	leneleven ratingfour however the shift key could be either less sensitive or moved.
4408	1355016584189	4	lenthirteen ratingfour often times when i hit the "a" key i hit the shift key.
4409	1355015037970	5	lenthree ratingfive helps a lot!
4410	1355014329309	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard.
4411	1355010282755	5	lentwelve ratingfive i was ready to toss my samsung s3 prior to discovering this keyboard.
4412	1355010282755	5	lensix ratingfive unreal auto correct capabilities and speed.
4413	1355009794820	1	lenseven ratingone i can't download the language pack.
4414	1355009794820	1	lenfour ratingone it's completely useless.
4415	1355009257697	5	leneight ratingfive much better predictability and customization than samsung keyboard
4416	1355005325924	5	lennine ratingfive without this app, i would switch to the iphone.
4417	1355004264608	3	lennine ratingthree good app but the turkish dictionary is very insufficient.
4418	1355004264608	3	lenseven ratingthree it doesn't contain many basic words.
4419	1355148972102	5	lentwelve ratingfive i wish google to purchase this one and keep as default keyboard.
4420	1355148972102	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i used more then 5 apps for replacement of swipe but swiftkey has no competition.
4421	1355148972102	5	lenthree ratingfive simply the bestest
4422	1355148141392	4	lenseventeen ratingfour i love this keyboard, it has ruined me for other mobile devices and even my pc keyboard.
4423	1355148141392	4	lenfifteen ratingfour but since i root my phone, i constantly change roms, therefore reseting all my words.
4424	1355148141392	4	lensix ratingfour it feels bad reseting 2000 custom words.
4425	1355145956808	5	lenten ratingfive this is the best keyboard i've used on android.
4426	1355145956808	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive my favorite feature is that the period, comma, exclamation mark, and question mark all share the same key (with the period key as primary).
4427	1355145956808	5	lenseventeen ratingfive numbers are available on their own alternate keyboard with a rich number of other symbols as well.
4428	1355145070166	3	lenfiftynine ratingthree i was hoping to have a good heart symbol with the key board because that's something a girl uses a lot for commenting on photos and stuff like that if added, and i would be much happier with the application and rate it a five stars but, there are not a lot of color choices for your keyboard.
4429	1355145070166	3	lensix ratingthree especially if this application costs money.
4430	1355145037422	4	leneighteen ratingfour the functional keys in the bottom: shift, enter, backspace etc. come in a certain color with every theme.
4431	1355145037422	4	leneighteen ratingfour i would like this color to be fully customisable to make it fit my phone's theme better.
4432	1355142272037	1	lentwelve ratingone easy to use, the more you use it the better it gets.
4433	1355142272037	1	lenthirteen ratingone just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
4434	1355142272037	1	leneight ratingone reset of phone required to fix issue temporarily.
4435	1355142272037	1	lenthree ratingone razr m, jb 4.1.1
4436	1355140399197	5	lenthree ratingfive definitely best keyboard.
4437	1355140399197	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i am using both english and turkish dictionaries and haven't seen any issue yet.
4438	1355137797437	5	lenseven ratingfive perfect prediction and very smooth to use
4439	1355137211595	5	leneleven ratingfive it's a clever little app that makes typing a joy.
4440	1355137211595	5	lennine ratingfive with great customisation available for you to choose from!
4441	1355137211595	5	lenten ratingfive and also making it to fit your needs is great!
4442	1355135875199	3	lenten ratingthree best prediction keyboard available but mediocre design and button placement.
4443	1355135875199	3	lensix ratingthree could do better in that department
4444	1355133014250	5	lenthirty ratingfive i didn't like the stock keyboard that my galaxy s2 had at all, i tried the trail version of this app, and i just had to buy the pro version!
4445	1355133014250	5	lenthree ratingfive totally worth it.
4446	1355131811788	5	lentwo ratingfive simply great.
4447	1355124853837	5	lenseventeen ratingfive typing on mobile always require a help and this help this time come from this excellent app.
4448	1355121597830	4	lenthirteen ratingfour amazing keyboard and good value but it needs to have slide/swipe options.
4449	1355121005690	5	lensix ratingfive the best keyboard for android, period.
4450	1355121005690	5	leneight ratingfive the predictions are so good, it's spooky.
4451	1355121005690	5	lentwo ratingfive galaxy nexus.
4452	1355115339633	1	lentwentyone ratingone predictions and double space bar to accept predictions and insert period are not longer available in browsers and many other apps.
4453	1355115339633	1	lenthree ratingone basically useless keyboard.
4454	1355114876028	2	lenfive ratingtwo spell check randomly stops working.
4455	1355114568518	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive best app i've ever bought hands down the original auto correct for me samsung s3 is garbage this app is untouchable to the rest
4456	1355114167053	2	lenten ratingtwo prediction will sometimes turn off when i sleep the phone.
4457	1355110631436	4	leneleven ratingfour need s-pen button and writing grid for the galaxy note!
4458	1355110631436	4	lenthree ratingfour otherwise not bad.
4459	1355110631436	4	lennine ratingfour samsung could learn a couple things from this keyboard.
4460	1355110501125	4	lenthirteen ratingfour needs better emotes and i thinks that's it except maybe custom keyboards.
4461	1355107545999	4	leneighteen ratingfour if you could customize the keyboard to a different colour for all keyboards, i will give you 5 stars.
4462	1355107545999	4	lenten ratingfour the back-spacing on the keyboard is a bit slow.
4463	1355107545999	4	lensix ratingfour i wish i could adjust it.
4464	1355105721064	5	lennine ratingfive this is a great keyboard, it works very well.
4465	1355105721064	5	leneleven ratingfive the more i use it, the better it works for me.
4466	1355105370978	2	lentwentyfour ratingtwo this work great for a while but now keeps crashing my phone and my phone won't work again until i pull the battery
4467	1355104973131	5	lensix ratingfive worth the several bucks for sure!
4468	1355103931596	5	leneighteen ratingfive better than the ios keyboard this is well worth the money as more features eg different keyboard sizes.
4469	1355103931596	5	lennine ratingfive truely impressed and saves me time correcting my mistakes.
4470	1355103609595	5	lentwentythree ratingfive just need to be sure that you check over what you're typing as it can get weird if you're not careful.
4471	1355103609595	5	lennineteen ratingfive also, if you mess up and lose a comment you were in the middle of, swiftkey can remember it.
4472	1355102994329	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard i've ever used.
4473	1355102994329	5	lenfourteen ratingfive it really is crazy how good it is at guessing what you're typing.
4474	1355102994329	5	lentwentynine ratingfive from a die hard swype user that was crushed when he got the dna and saw how bad htc's slide keyboard is, this is well worth your money.
4475	1355100324015	4	lenfour ratingfour just add swype pleeease
4476	1355099093111	5	lennineteen ratingfive takes a few days to get used to, but an awesome tool once you get the hang of it!
4477	1355093286909	4	lentwo ratingfour great app.
4478	1355093286909	4	lenthree ratingfour reads my mind.
4479	1355093286909	4	lennineteen ratingfour only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is i can not use swype as on the samsung keyboard.
4480	1355092832072	5	lentwentyone ratingfive this is the best keyboard app that i've have used especially when you are using this keyboard across multiple device
4481	1355092557624	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny
4482	1355262610312	5	lentwentynine ratingfive not only does it predict what i say from sms & gmail very well but i love the press & hold character feature, saves so much time instead of switching screens.
4483	1355262610312	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it predicts and auto corrects so well i rarely press the wrong buttons.
4484	1355262610312	5	lenseventeen ratingfive and the fact u can change the colour and it has pink, well fuschia, my favourite colour!
4485	1355262610312	5	lenfive ratingfive i just love this keyboard.
4486	1355262021349	4	lenfifteen ratingfour it works great for everything but not so good when add ing non common names.
4487	1355262021349	4	lenten ratingfour i live in hawaii and the language here is different
4488	1355258895192	5	lenseven ratingfive the best keyboard i've ever used.
4489	1355258895192	5	lenthree ratingfive samsung galaxy note 2.
4490	1355258112912	1	leneighteen ratingone something is happening and it is causing me to have to download the language over and over again.
4491	1355256571407	3	leneight ratingthree but i would love a cleaner looking interface.
4492	1355256571407	3	lenseventeen ratingthree would love to have a option to hide all the extra long press keys minus the numbers.
4493	1355255874223	2	lentwentyfour ratingtwo changed my mind, good to start with but you would think it gets better with time, in actual fact it's become quite annoying.
4494	1355255874223	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo frankly some of the predictions are ridiculous you are better off with the normal keyboard.
4495	1355255874223	2	lennine ratingtwo gets two stars because of the good theme options.
4496	1355253423755	5	lentwelve ratingfive this keyboard is the best app i have ever spent money on.
4497	1355253423755	5	lenfour ratingfive definitely worth the money.
4498	1355253423755	5	lenfourteen ratingfive the predictive text always me to text much faster and more clearly than ever.
4499	1355252660120	5	lentwelve ratingfive it has the most minor glitches but is still the perfect keyboard.
4500	1355252660120	5	lenfour ratingfive completely worth the price
4501	1355252290908	3	lennine ratingthree great app but becomes sluggish every now and then.
4502	1355252290908	3	lenten ratingthree i am resorting to my stock keyboard more often now.
4503	1355249208296	4	lennine ratingfour was working excellently on 4.0.3, but in 4.0.4, has some defects.
4504	1355249208296	4	lenfifteen ratingfour feeling a small hick when keyboard comes on screen and sometimes it does not work.
4505	1355249208296	4	lentwo ratingfour pls resolve
4506	1355245564583	3	lenfive ratingthree not compatible with jelly bean.
4507	1355245564583	3	lenfive ratingthree resets after boot or restart.
4508	1355245564583	3	lenseven ratingthree will not set itself as default keyboard.
4509	1355245145614	1	lensix ratingone this app was amazing in gingerbread!
4510	1355245145614	1	lenseventeen ratingone i recommended it to all of my friends, but ever since ics this app has been horrible.
4511	1355245145614	1	lenfive ratingone the keyboard is horribly laggy.
4512	1355245145614	1	lentwenty ratingone it's really too bad because this is an amazing keyboard, but i'm unable to use :(. please fix this
4513	1355245046770	5	leneight ratingfive really saves time and corrects every typing error.
4514	1355244286785	5	lentwenty ratingfive this keyboard is so good, really easy to use and keeps getting better as it learns the words you use.
4515	1355244286785	5	lensix ratingfive well worth upgrading after the trial.
4516	1355244077015	5	lennine ratingfive has nw been installed so happy nw thank you
4517	1355243348965	5	lenseven ratingfive so easy to set up and use.
4518	1355243348965	5	leneleven ratingfive it's in a completely different league to the samsung keyboard.
4519	1355240948828	5	lenseven ratingfive this keyboard is awesome than the stock.
4520	1355240948828	5	lenten ratingfive it really improve my typing and suit my typing style.
4521	1355236136451	1	lentwelve ratingone i've downloaded it more than 3 times and it keeps saying error
4522	1355231941117	5	lennine ratingfive the default keyboards on my note suffer from lag.
4523	1355231941117	5	lenthirtythree ratingfive i bought this keyboard because i had heard great things about it and frankly was just tired of my default keyboards freezing up or the pop up letter being 2 or 3 key strokes behind.
4524	1355231941117	5	lenseven ratingfive buy this, you won't regret it.
4525	1355231941117	5	lentwo ratingfive thanks devs.
4526	1355230718901	5	lentwelve ratingfive awesome keyboard, one of the most innovative apps that i have seen.
4527	1355230718901	5	lentwentyone ratingfive only issue found till date is that it crashes often with chrome, but that is not a deal breaker for me.
4528	1355230718901	5	lentwo ratingfive rating 5 stars
4529	1355229569420	4	lentwelve ratingfour trumps the moto photon defaut, go keyboard, and all other keyboard apps.
4530	1355229569420	4	lenfour ratingfour worth the few dollars.
4531	1355229569420	4	lenfive ratingfour only complaint: no swype mode.
4532	1355229352740	5	leneight ratingfive would be better if echo stopped cheating though
4533	1355214006897	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard.
4534	1355214006897	5	lenthirteen ratingfive would be cool if we could have some emojis added on to it
4535	1355213404728	5	lenfourteen ratingfive do it a lot easier to type in and the prediction engine is amazing!
4536	1355213277730	1	lensix ratingone due to error 941 this is bs.
4537	1355208762383	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i don't always use this keyboard, i much prefer swype for one handed use when i'm on the go.
4538	1355208762383	5	lennine ratingfive but swiftkey is extremely useful for two handed use
4539	1355205283729	2	lenfive ratingtwo wouldn't install on my gs3
4540	1355204447340	1	lenten ratingone i just purchased this app but it says error downloading.
4541	1355203265833	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour i enjoy this app as it helps correct my errors fast but it doesn't remember the personal words i put in.
4542	1355203265833	4	lennine ratingfour and i'd like to see more, newer themes.
4543	1355200992340	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i downloaded this app hoping for an escape from the horrendous galaxy s3 default keyboard.
4544	1355200992340	5	lenseven ratingfive i got far more than i expected.
4545	1355200992340	5	leneleven ratingfive i've had it about a month, and it's great.
4546	1355200992340	5	lenseven ratingfive the auto correct in particular impresses me.
4547	1355200992340	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i can type very fast without worrying at all and it'll get it right every time.
4548	1355200992340	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive no loss of functionality (unless you liked swype.  i didn't.), smooth interface, highly customizable, and it learns from your typing style.
4549	1355200992340	5	lennine ratingfive i recommend this to all my android-using friends.
4550	1355200992340	5	lenthree ratingfive totally worth it.
4551	1355200689427	3	lennine ratingthree the notification to choose keyboard won't go away.
4552	1355200689427	3	lenthree ratingthree will probably uninstall.
4553	1355200569828	5	leneighteen ratingfive took a little while to get it just how i wanted but will never change it now,  great
4554	1355200186862	5	lenfifteen ratingfive multilingual support and amazing predictive ability (seriously -  sometimes i don't even need to type!).
4555	1355200186862	5	leneighteen ratingfive i've been spoiled by swiftkey - it just makes all other keyboards seem cumbersome and difficult to use.
4556	1355200186862	5	lenfive ratingfive worth every cent i paid!
4557	1355196913897	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this app!
4558	1355196913897	5	lentwenty ratingfive i recently got a galaxy s3 and i thought i would never be able to type well on a touch screen.
4559	1355196913897	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive it makes it so much easier to type quickly and the predictive texting is really handy when i can't use two hands to type.
4560	1355196913897	5	lenseventeen ratingfive it's saved me so much time and i have yet to notice a bug or glitch!
4561	1355196913897	5	lenseventeen ratingfive the only thing that i can think of to make this app better would be more themes!
4562	1355196913897	5	lennine ratingfive but as it is i am more than pleased.
4563	1355194248717	5	leneleven ratingfive first app i load on any new android including my nexus 4.
4564	1355194248717	5	lenfive ratingfive especially like new flow version.
4565	1355194248717	5	lentwo ratingfive great stuff.
4566	1355192143047	5	lensixteen ratingfive my free trial ended and i used the stock on for about 30 minutes then purchased this.
4567	1355192143047	5	leneleven ratingfive you have no idea what your missing this app is amazing.
4568	1355192143047	5	lentwo ratingfive great job!
4569	1355192143047	5	leneleven ratingfive i just wish there was an option to hide the keyboard.
4570	1355192143047	5	lentwo ratingfive htc rezound
4571	1355191304609	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome keyboard!
4572	1355191304609	5	lennine ratingfive typing is fast and the auto correction is amazing.
4573	1355191304609	5	lenten ratingfive they finally fixed most, if not all of the issue.
4574	1355191304609	5	lenten ratingfive bigger space bar, more themes, faster responses, and more intuitive.
4575	1355185813701	1	lensix ratingone good app when it actually works.
4576	1355185813701	1	lentwelve ratingone every time you reboot your device it reverts back to stock keyboard!
4577	1355185813701	1	lenfive ratingone only happens with paid version!
4578	1355183906564	4	lenfourteen ratingfour well nothing more to say than that i love this keyboard a hell lot.
4579	1355183906564	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour as mentioned by some others some times it seems to slow down on certain other apps while the original never did so.
4580	1355183906564	4	lentwentyseven ratingfour i sure don't mind but at the same time making even speedier and smooth as jelly bean is on my s3 would always be greatly appreciate it.
4581	1355179292717	5	lenthirtyeight ratingfive this is the only keyboard that really works perfectly with android i've used almost all keyboards, with low and high rating in a search for a keyboard that makes my life easier and this is the one.
4582	1355179292717	5	lensixteen ratingfive i bought a visa card just to download the full version and am happy with that.
4583	1355177320617	5	leneleven ratingfive my typing skills on a smartphone were awful before this app.
4584	1355177320617	5	lentwelve ratingfive i now i can type an error free message in a second.
4585	1355175612136	5	lenthree ratingfive deserves my comment!
4586	1355175612136	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this keyboard is quicker to me than regular texting because the prediction is on point!
4587	1355175612136	5	lentwentysix ratingfive and the community is pretty cool to submitting ideas and they can be voted up and considered, prime example "flow" .even this beta keyboard is perfect.
4588	1355175612136	5	leneight ratingfive amazing work guys! - galaxy nexus *android rev hd 8.0.0*
4589	1355173306899	5	lentwelve ratingfive this is the best keyboard available if you don't use swype.
4590	1355173306899	5	lentwelve ratingfive they updated recently with two new themes, but they're too girly.
4591	1355173306899	5	lenten ratingfive it would be nice if it used the personal dictionary.
4592	1355172707780	5	lenseven ratingfive best android keyboard i've ever used.
4593	1355171578133	4	lentwelve ratingfour it's sad to know your keyboard is more intelligent than you.
4594	1355171578133	4	lenthirteen ratingfour developers could add a slide type of writing and that would be awesome.
4595	1355171578133	4	leneight ratingfour after all we paid 4 bucks for it right?
4596	1355171383591	5	leneight ratingfive best keyboard i've ever used to type.
4597	1355171383591	5	lenten ratingfive i've never types so fast in a touch keyboard.
4598	1355171383591	5	lenseven ratingfive very smart and very fast with predictions.
4599	1355171383591	5	lenfive ratingfive definitely a must download app!
4600	1355171383591	5	lentwenty ratingfive in my opinion its better than swype, it will be even better once swiftkey flow comes out on gapp store.
4601	1355169955838	5	lenseven ratingfive you will not find a better keyboard!
4602	1355162744835	5	lennine ratingfive it's amazing how predictions works with this app.
4603	1355162744835	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i like to type fast and i hate to be lazy writing a text.
4604	1355162744835	5	leneight ratingfive absolutely this app help me with all features.
4605	1355161384006	4	leneleven ratingfour i would give it a 5 if i support chinese as well.
4606	1355160246948	5	leneleven ratingfive used it for a few days then purchased the full app.
4607	1355155667386	1	leneighteen ratingone i was a big fan of this keyboard when i first purchased it, worked well, smooth and accurate.
4608	1355155667386	1	lentwentyseven ratingone but after a month of having it, it became extremely slow, typing on the screen would not happen, half the time corrections would not even show up.
4609	1355155667386	1	lenfourteen ratingone i have contacted the developers about this problem and they were nothing but useless!
4610	1355155667386	1	lenfifteen ratingone no help what so ever, they came off as if they did not believe me.
4611	1355155667386	1	lentwentysix ratingone it is a real shame because the application had great potential but when developers do not keep up with bugs, it goes down hill very fast.
4612	1355155667386	1	lenfourteen ratingone my default keyboard, is better than this and my default keyboard is absolute crap!
4613	1355151732999	5	leneleven ratingfive i am 55 and tried different keyboards before but love this one.
4614	1355151732999	5	lennine ratingfive bought thumb keyboard before which i did not like.
4615	1355151732999	5	lenten ratingfive this one improves my texting speed and less wrong letters.
4616	1355435769185	2	lennine ratingtwo a lot of bugs in connection with hardware keyboards!
4617	1355435769185	2	lennine ratingtwo the app also has trouble downloading the language packs .
4618	1355434198259	1	leneighteen ratingone so, i downloaded the trial app and fell in love with this setup over my factory siii keyboard.
4619	1355434198259	1	leneleven ratingone i used until trial period ran out, then purchased the app.
4620	1355434198259	1	lentwentyseven ratingone now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up at all and it seems like words are being put in that i never was attempting to write.
4621	1355434198259	1	lentwentyfive ratingone also, i am not too fond of the fact that when i do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
4622	1355434198259	1	leneight ratingone downloaded to make life easier, not so much.
4623	1355432840248	5	lenfour ratingfive better than default keyboard
4624	1355432403544	5	lensix ratingfive the best app i have downloaded.
4625	1355431978589	5	lenfourteen ratingfive as nice as the original swiftkey was the new slide is way, way better!
4626	1355431733365	5	lenfour ratingfive word predictions are good.
4627	1355430801690	2	leneleven ratingtwo love the word suggestions but keyboard locks up constantly on my s3
4628	1355426649386	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome apps.
4629	1355426649386	5	lennine ratingfive waiting for swiftkey flow to get a full release!
4630	1355426490762	5	lennine ratingfive but can we have more themes for the keyboard =)
4631	1355426218199	5	lentwentythree ratingfive edit: the keyboard stop predicting when i am in any.do, facebook web browser and several other applications that i couldn't remember.
4632	1355426218199	5	lentwenty ratingfive it would be better if these things are fixed, but i can live without those problems getting in my way.
4633	1355426218199	5	lenfive ratingfive still 5 stars, good job devs!
4634	1355423340988	3	lenthirtysix ratingthree though india is a big client of all mobile handsets and apps, everybody is neglecting indian customers and their needs,i am hopefully waiting for hindi,marathi and other indian languages upgrade packs from swiftkey asap.
4635	1355423340988	3	lenseventeen ratingthree 3 stars for your best work and another 2 will be given to you after fulfillment of my demands
4636	1355421746297	5	lenfourteen ratingfive it fixes all my mistakes and even knows what i am about to write.
4637	1355421746297	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it is the best thing i ever payed for on the play store.
4638	1355419197236	5	lenfour ratingfive awesome app works perfect
4639	1355418802781	3	leneighteen ratingthree when this app actually comes up on my screen when i go to type something i love it.
4640	1355418802781	3	lenforty ratingthree however,  every time i close all apps and ram memory and i go on any sort of message board,  texting or any type of typing it doesn't automatically pop up with swiftkey and it shows the regular crappy keyboard.
4641	1355418802781	3	lentwenty ratingthree long story short i have to go change the options to have swiftkey on every time i want to text.
4642	1355417596041	5	lennineteen ratingfive only app ive ever spent money on and ever reviewed for that matter, but this app is worth it.
4643	1355417596041	5	lenten ratingfive keyboard works really well, especially for those who type quickly.
4644	1355417596041	5	leneight ratingfive literally memorizes how u usually respond to people.
4645	1355417596041	5	lennine ratingfive all around a great upgrade from the regular keyboard.
4646	1355417596041	5	lenthirteen ratingfive there is a reason its the top paid app in the app store.
4647	1355414112777	5	lenthirteen ratingfive my typing speed has increased considerably with this app and making less mistakes.
4648	1355414112777	5	lensixteen ratingfive i type in english and spanish and the app makes accurate predictions on both languages simultaneously.
4649	1355414112777	5	lentwo ratingfive great job!
4650	1355414112777	5	lentwentyone ratingfive suggestion for the developer: make that when the hardware is changed you don't loose all that the app has learned.
4651	1355413613552	5	leneleven ratingfive best keyboard i've ever had love the orange pumpkin theme!
4652	1355413613552	5	lenthree ratingfive bought and loved!
4653	1355413554249	5	leneleven ratingfive it changes the way you use your phone it works perfectly.
4654	1355413554249	5	lensixteen ratingfive i wish there were more personalization options with colors, to match the theme for your phone.
4655	1355413554249	5	lenfourteen ratingfive the application is amazing and seriously i am twice as fast when i text.
4656	1355413554249	5	lenthree ratingfive makes swype obsolete.
4657	1355413554249	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i have bigger thumbs and even though the keys look smaller they work much better even if your fingers touch other keys.
4658	1355413554249	5	lenfifteen ratingfive it does know how you text people and it gives you some great auto corrects.
4659	1355412684210	4	lenfive ratingfour great keyboard for typing fast.
4660	1355412684210	4	lensix ratingfour won't start automatically on gs3 however.
4661	1355411645648	2	lensix ratingtwo i use to live this app.
4662	1355411645648	2	leneight ratingtwo but it is not compatible with 4.1.1  so frustrated.
4663	1355405995058	5	lenseven ratingfive i try a lot of different keyboards.
4664	1355405995058	5	leneight ratingfive i loved swype but this is even better.
4665	1355405085780	3	lennineteen ratingthree it's a very good idea and app, but the smarter it got, the mora annoyed i've got.
4666	1355405085780	3	lenten ratingthree it tries to guess words and can get really annoying.
4667	1355404069625	5	lentwo ratingfive great app.
4668	1355404069625	5	lenfour ratingfive good voice recognition also.
4669	1355403120155	4	lentwo ratingfour unbelievable app.
4670	1355403120155	4	lenseven ratingfour great predictions the best keyboard out there.
4671	1355401986116	5	lenten ratingfive this is the only app i've ever paid for.
4672	1355401986116	5	lenfive ratingfive it's awesome no regrets
4673	1355397843908	3	lensix ratingthree not so good compare to swiftkey 1.
4674	1355397843908	3	lenten ratingthree or maybe it's this samsung galaxy 3 i'm using.
4675	1355397843908	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree had swiftkey 1 with my htc desire hd the swiftkey keyboard appeared with the prediction bar when i'm on the internet browser.
4676	1355397843908	3	lenthirteen ratingthree but the predictions bar doesn't appear for for the samsung at all.
4677	1355397843908	3	lenthirteen ratingthree and when i'm typing rapidly and trying to press the space button.
4678	1355397032570	5	lentwelve ratingfive flipping amazing keyboard that just knows what you are going to type.
4679	1355392503012	1	leneighteen ratingone split keyboard does not work on the note in spite of thousands of users flagging it inside reviews.
4680	1355392503012	1	lennine ratingone makes the whole point of the tablet version redundant.
4681	1355392503012	1	leneleven ratingone use thumb keyboard instead - at least it delivers what it promises.
4682	1355392503012	1	leneight ratingone swiftkey is a waste of money, developers unresponsive
4683	1355390696618	5	lenseven ratingfive easy to use, great features set, brilliant
4684	1355386272008	5	lennine ratingfive it really helps me typing fast without many errors
4685	1355382609400	3	lennine ratingthree i hope that swiftkeys will implement chinese typing too.
4686	1355382609400	3	lenfive ratingthree else, its still pretty awesome!
4687	1355382512935	3	lentwelve ratingthree the keyboard gets laggy sometimes and makes apps lag on jelly bean.
4688	1355382512935	3	lenfour ratingthree most notably google now.
4689	1355382512935	3	lenseven ratingthree it's very slow whilst using swiftkey.
4690	1355380474966	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this by far has to be the best keyboard on the android market!
4691	1355380474966	5	lenfive ratingfive the auto correct is flawless!
4692	1355380474966	5	leneight ratingfive i am very happy satisfied with this keyboard.
4693	1355380474966	5	lenten ratingfive don't even get me started on the predictive text!
4694	1355380394321	5	leneight ratingfive i wish there will be more themes added
4695	1355380385600	5	lenthree ratingfive please integrate swype.
4696	1355380385600	5	lenseven ratingfive other than that i love this app
4697	1355378927658	5	leneleven ratingfive this app lays waste to all built in or aftermarket keyboards.
4698	1355378927658	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive it's customizable, and it learns your writing style, and vocabulary, and the predictions are on the spot from the very beginning.
4699	1355378927658	5	lenfourteen ratingfive at least try the free version, but either way you will not be displeased.
4700	1355378927658	5	lenseven ratingfive i never spend money on apps.ever.
4701	1355378927658	5	lenten ratingfive this one was an exception because i was blown away.
4702	1355378927658	5	lennine ratingfive this app makes my keyboard use so much easier.
4703	1355378927658	5	lenseven ratingfive try it, buy it, just get it.
4704	1355377864483	5	lenthirteen ratingfive makes typing a breeze on my htc explorer which has a small screen.
4705	1355377864483	5	leneight ratingfive the team is very responsive to any issues.
4706	1355377545572	5	lenthree ratingfive i love swiftkey.
4707	1355377545572	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this keyboard has made my texting on a touch phone really easy and fast!
4708	1355377545572	5	leneighteen ratingfive sometimes i don't even need to edit what i type cause this app corrects it for me!
4709	1355377545572	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i have tried the free trial at first, figuring the trial might end.
4710	1355377545572	5	lenseventeen ratingfive so i bought the app when it was on a promotion for just 99 cent! original price is 3.99!
4711	1355377545572	5	lentwentynine ratingfive anyway i couldn't thank swiftkey any better for such an amazing keyboard, just wish that they will come out with better features and personalization along with new themes!
4712	1355374300250	1	lenfive ratingone prediction does not work anymore.
4713	1355374300250	1	lenfour ratingone it is extremely frustrating.
4714	1355374300250	1	lentwo ratingone galaxy note 2.
4715	1355373024242	5	lensix ratingfive i absolutely love this keyboard app.
4716	1355373024242	5	leneight ratingfive i only wish they had more color scheme.
4717	1355373024242	5	lensix ratingfive other than that, top rated keyboard.
4718	1355372645432	5	leneleven ratingfive makes typing extremely easy and much better than the stock keyboard.
4719	1355372645432	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommended!
4720	1355368418146	5	leneleven ratingfive the best keyboard i've tried, shortens my texting time greatly
4721	1355367522452	1	lenfourteen ratingone with a recent update to jellybean, swiftkey no longer automatically uses predictions when texting.
4722	1355367522452	1	lentwentytwo ratingone i have to back out of every message and go back in before it will start fixing typos or using predictive text.
4723	1355367522452	1	lenfour ratingone huge waste of money!
4724	1355367522452	1	lenthree ratingone galaxy s3 with sprint.
4725	1355367402344	5	lennine ratingfive i'm typing this reviwy blazing fast right now!
4726	1355366019799	3	leneight ratingthree i used the trial version for a month.
4727	1355366019799	3	lentwelve ratingthree it learned my typing style and i had my settings tweaked perfectly.
4728	1355366019799	3	lenfourteen ratingthree i was very disappointed that when installing the paid version it did not import.
4729	1355366019799	3	lentwentyfour ratingthree the settings from the trial version and now i am left having to battle the same initial problems when i first inatalled the trial.
4730	1355366019799	3	lenfifteen ratingthree very disappointing that such an intuitive app is so non-intuitive in the upgrade process
4731	1355362305759	1	lentwenty ratingone since i updated my s3 to kelly bean sometimes swiftkey is not even activating when i go to text or type.
4732	1355362305759	1	lenthirtyfour ratingone i have to exit whatever i'm doing or send a text or 2 before it will start working, but as i said it's very inconsistent, was never an issue while using with ics.
4733	1355357169723	5	lenfourteen ratingfive lots of people complain that the program inputs a space after a period automatically.
4734	1355357169723	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i complained about it too until i got use to not having to input spaces.
4735	1355357169723	5	leneleven ratingfive now this program is saveing me hundreds of keystrokes a week.
4736	1355357169723	5	lentwelve ratingfive and a must have app for the galaxy s3 which has no autocorrect.
4737	1355355301958	5	leneleven ratingfive literally bought this after sending one text with the trial version.
4738	1355355301958	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive i questioned never getting a touch smart phone again because of how much time i waste just trying to get the terrible samsung keyboard to write what i want; problem solved!
4739	1355354242147	5	lennine ratingfive it's so much faster to swipe to type!
4740	1355353272486	4	lenfiftyone ratingfour i love this keyboard hands down the best one on the market only issue is for some reason when i i'm typing fast the keyboard always seems to static like a tv with no service i thought it was my phone but now i have the note 2 n same thing.
4741	1355353253654	4	lentwentyseven ratingfour i just hate how when i click the 123 icon on the keyboard i hate how the layout looks,  im use to the regular s3 keyboard 123456789 on the top
4742	1355351597238	5	leneleven ratingfive 5 stars either way but an emoji add on would be awesome.
4743	1355351597238	5	lenten ratingfive still it blows every other keyboard out of the water.
4744	1355348732943	3	leneleven ratingthree i like it's ability to predict what i'm writing.
4745	1355348732943	3	lentwelve ratingthree i don't like the way that it handles using different languages.
4746	1355348732943	3	leneighteen ratingthree i wish there was a way to toggle between languages instead of having them integrated into one keyboard.
4747	1355348125440	3	lenthirteen ratingthree would have given this 5 stars if it worked well with king soft office.
4748	1355346992143	5	lenfive ratingfive nicer, bigger keyboard, better predictions.
4749	1355346992143	5	lensix ratingfive definitely my favouritekeyboard in  landscape format
4750	1355342840792	5	leneleven ratingfive this is the best keyboard i have ever seen and used!
4751	1355342840792	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i've had it for quite a while now, it is worth the few bucks you have to pay for it.
4752	1355342840792	5	leneight ratingfive i know i wouldn't text without it!
4753	1355340253176	5	lentwelve ratingfive i type interchangeably between english and spanish, and it is absolutely seamless.
4754	1355340253176	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive i just keep my keyboard in qwerty(espa?ol), and the only difference this makes is when you hold down vowels you can get accents, and there is one extra button (?).
4755	1355340253176	5	lentwentynine ratingfive i can actually switch languages mid sentence (without having to change a setting or push a button or anything) and it will start predicting and correcting in that language.
4756	1355340253176	5	leneleven ratingfive its language detection is amazing, and never gets in your way.
4757	1355340253176	5	lenfive ratingfive keep it up dev team!
4758	1355339139494	5	lenseven ratingfive a well deserved number 1 app on android.
4759	1355339139494	5	lentwelve ratingfive only stayed on the free version for 2 hours and had to purchase.
4760	1355339139494	5	lensix ratingfive drawback, could do with more skins.
4761	1355338660279	4	lenthirtyfour ratingfour great keyboard only issue i have is when my phone wakes into a text it doesn't use prediction so i have to back out and go back in for the prediction to work
4762	1355338060932	4	lennine ratingfour was working excellently on 4.0.3, but in 4.0.4, has some defects.
4763	1355338060932	4	lenfifteen ratingfour feeling a small hick when keyboard comes on screen and sometimes it does not work.
4764	1355338060932	4	lentwo ratingfour pls resolve
4765	1355336831152	3	lensix ratingthree congrats on getting top paid app.
4766	1355336831152	3	lennineteen ratingthree the beta flow is great but for now takes up too much memory for my ol evo to handle.
4767	1355336831152	3	leneighteen ratingthree can't go without this keyboard anymore, though i'd still love to be able to disable gestures
4768	1355336023784	5	lenthree ratingfive love this keyboard!
4769	1355336023784	5	lenfive ratingfive it does occasionally stop typing.
4770	1355335902543	5	lentwo ratingfive favorite keyboard.
4771	1355335902543	5	lenfour ratingfive try the new "swype"
4772	1355335902543	5	lenthree ratingfive download for swiftkey.
4773	1355334039831	5	lennine ratingfive this is the only app i have ever bought.
4774	1355334039831	5	leneighteen ratingfive i first downloaded the free trial but once that ran out, i had to have the full version.
4775	1355334039831	5	lenseven ratingfive it predicts not only words but sentences.
4776	1355332559153	3	lensix ratingthree kinda laggy when opening and closing.
4777	1355332559153	3	lensixteen ratingthree not a big deal for me but it looks bad when someone's watching my phone.
4778	1355330727674	5	lenfive ratingfive the predictions are depressingly accurate.
4779	1355330727674	5	lentwelve ratingfive the interface and special key layout are the best i've seen.
4780	1355322830629	5	lentwo ratingfive more themes!
4781	1355319211151	4	lentwelve ratingfour easy to use, the more you use it the better it gets.
4782	1355319211151	4	lenthirteen ratingfour just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
4783	1355319211151	4	leneight ratingfour reset of phone required to fix issue temporarily.
4784	1355319211151	4	lenthree ratingfour razr m, jb 4.1.1.
4785	1355319211151	4	lenthirteen ratingfour edit: after several reboots and deleting app data, sk3 seems to be stable again.
4786	1355319211151	4	lennineteen ratingfour frustrating since i had to delete all of the learned suggestions, but it's back so i'm happy.
4787	1355318912363	5	lenthirteen ratingfive also very useful for polyglot people (no need to switch languages ever again)
4788	1355316405360	5	lenseven ratingfive hmmm.guess the app is that good
4789	1355308801346	5	leneleven ratingfive the arabic implementation is very good but needs some fine tuning
4790	1355305846749	2	lenfive ratingtwo stock keyboard, just as good.
4791	1355305846749	2	lensix ratingtwo can't remember my email address.
4792	1355305846749	2	lensix ratingtwo has a problem remembering simple words.
4793	1355304938006	3	lenthirteen ratingthree please fix the cause for the keyboard not sticking as the default keyboard.
4794	1355304938006	3	lentwentyone ratingthree we waited months for 4.1 and it's impossible to tell how long it will take to get 4.2 especially for international users.
4795	1355304938006	3	lentwentyeight ratingthree everyone here paid good money for the app please look for a work around other then waiting for 4.2 to be released only then will i give it 5 stars.
4796	1355304938006	3	lenfourteen ratingthree the two stars that are missing reflect developer involvement to solve a known issue.
4797	1355298025455	3	lentwentythree ratingthree i used this a long time ago, and picked it up for a buck during the sale, but it needs more customization options.
4798	1355298025455	3	lenseven ratingthree namely, the smiley key needs custom smileys.
4799	1355295538028	1	lentwelve ratingone pls update thai language i have been waiting for the long time
4800	1355294662718	2	lenseven ratingtwo sometimes word prediction doesn't show up.
4801	1355294662718	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo have to exit out of keyboard then get back on again for it to appear.
4802	1355289563507	5	lenthirteen ratingfive really loving it ;)  wish it wouldnt eat so much ram tho 28mb of ram?!
4803	1355288429578	5	leneight ratingfive so far above other keyboards its almost sad.
4804	1355283343940	4	lenten ratingfour couldn't ask for a more perfect look and feel.
4805	1355283343940	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour i would like some more customization options, such as disabling the keypress letter highlight, custom skins (even if just hex colors from a file).
4806	1355277261407	5	lennineteen ratingfive i had such a hard time typing on my new gs3, because i am so used to a physical keyboard.
4807	1355277261407	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i so i tried this out on a whim and it is amazing.
4808	1355277261407	5	lentwenty ratingfive i i can type fast like a crazy person and it's like this thing knows what i'm thinking.
4809	1355277261407	5	lennine ratingfive i best app i have ever purchased bar none.
4810	1355276775010	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive i got this app on sale a while ago, and after using it for months, i honestly think i would have paid full price anyway.
4811	1355276775010	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i have no complaints, just a request that you keep adding new themes!
4812	1355276658412	5	lenfour ratingfive the best, excellent keyboard!
4813	1355276658412	5	lennine ratingfive english, of course, but with korea prediction and everything?
4814	1355272867456	4	leneight ratingfour the beta edition for thai has been expired.
4815	1355272867456	4	leneight ratingfour could you add it to any thai peoples?
4816	1355271597248	5	leneleven ratingfive i find everything about using the keyboard to type with brilliant.
4817	1355271597248	5	leneight ratingfive you'll think how you ever lived without!
4818	1355271597248	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive my only flaw is since the jelly bean update if i have the keyboard open in messages and my screen locks; once the screen comes back the prediction function doesn't work
4819	1355270954160	5	leneleven ratingfive want to change your keyboard in different ways download this application.
4820	1355265346241	5	lenfifteen ratingfive my favorite feature is that it detects when you don't hit the space bar.
4821	1355265023231	4	lenten ratingfour i used to use swype but it was never accurate.
4822	1355265023231	4	leneleven ratingfour this has made life so much easier and it's customizable!
4823	1355264846252	5	lentwenty ratingfive i have fat fingers but could operate an iphone ok. i switched to android and struggled with the stock keyboard.
4824	1355264846252	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i was going to sell my soul back to apple but now thanks to this my soul remains owned by google!
4825	1355264837931	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this application
4826	1355517087621	2	lenfour ratingtwo i love this app.
4827	1355517087621	2	leneleven ratingtwo i use it on my samsung galaxy s3 on android 4.1.1 jelly bean.
4828	1355517087621	2	leneleven ratingtwo the only complaint i do have are a couple of bugs.
4829	1355517087621	2	lentwentyeight ratingtwo on occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
4830	1355517087621	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo i am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to facebook.
4831	1355517087621	2	lenten ratingtwo it renders it useless anytime i see something facebook worthy.
4832	1355517087621	2	lentwelve ratingtwo i will give this app five stars when these things are fixed.
4833	1355515417977	1	lenfour ratingone fatal support for polish.
4834	1355515417977	1	lenthree ratingone waste of money.
4835	1355514141492	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i never buy apps and i never do reviews but this keyboard is so amazing it should come stock on all android phones.
4836	1355514141492	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i've sold phones for years but never have i used anything so user friendly and simple.
4837	1355512877829	5	lenthree ratingfive highly recommended app.
4838	1355512762993	4	lentwelve ratingfour i am updating my review after a few months of using swiftkey 3.
4839	1355512762993	4	lenfifteen ratingfour i really like the keyboard app, it is probably the best of its kind available.
4840	1355512762993	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i really dislike how it fails to show predictions during web browser use.
4841	1355512762993	4	leneighteen ratingfour totally annoying when i'm used to typing as best i can and picking predictions from the list.
4842	1355512134703	4	lenfour ratingfour i love this app!
4843	1355512134703	4	lentwentythree ratingfour the only issue with it is that about 35% of the time the prediction bar does not show up/auto correct does not work.
4844	1355512134703	4	lenfour ratingfour this is pretty annoying.
4845	1355512134703	4	lenfive ratingfour please look into this issue.
4846	1355509266622	5	leneight ratingfive fantastic keyboard, makes typing quicker and more efficient.
4847	1355509266622	5	lenfive ratingfive well worth the 2.99 price tag.
4848	1355507368923	2	lennine ratingtwo great app but becomes sluggish every now and then.
4849	1355507368923	2	lenten ratingtwo i am resorting to my stock keyboard more often now.
4850	1355505894177	5	lenfour ratingfive i never buy apps.
4851	1355504302333	4	leneighteen ratingfour however, give me the option to disable the auto space after punctuation and ill give it five stars.
4852	1355502433998	2	lentwentyseven ratingtwo it's not a bad keyboard replacement but it insists on putting a space after periods, making it a real pain to type urls into text messages.
4853	1355500379544	5	lenseven ratingfive amazing keyboard as new user to android.
4854	1355500379544	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i am using htc one x+ and it's working fabulously without any flaws.
4855	1355500379544	5	lenseventeen ratingfive the speed, touch feeling and everything is working better than any keyboard on any device and software.
4856	1355500379544	5	lentwentyone ratingfive to all the people who are wondering to buy it or not, just do it and you won't regret it.
4857	1355499285544	4	lentwentyone ratingfour i really love the keyboard,  i came from and iphone and it's been quite the easy switch because of swiftkey.
4858	1355499285544	4	lenthirteen ratingfour the only thing i really dislike is the space it adds after punctuation.
4859	1355499285544	4	lenthirtyfour ratingfour i'm used to typing correctly in the first place so i add the space myself and swiftkey adds one as well as you can see in this review with all the double spaces.
4860	1355499285544	4	lenfourteen ratingfour it's quite annoying,  and also the reason i rated it 4 stars instead of 5.
4861	1355499285544	4	leneight ratingfour make an option to toggle this setting,  please!
4862	1355498518688	5	lenthirteen ratingfive the only app i have ever purchased and it is worth every penny.
4863	1355498411330	5	lensixteen ratingfive i was addicted to swype on my galaxy note but this blows it out the water.
4864	1355497605387	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour i want to turn predictions completely off, but can't?  bought paid version because like the direction arrows at bottom of keyboard.
4865	1355497605387	4	lensix ratingfour 5 stars if could turn off predictions.
4866	1355496734566	5	lenthirteen ratingfive there is nothing negative about this app that i can find or see.
4867	1355496734566	5	leneleven ratingfive so much better then default or any other app iv tried
4868	1355496045978	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i was a little skeptical that one keyboard would be any better than another keyboard.
4869	1355496045978	5	lentwelve ratingfive i been using the standard droid keyboard that came with the phone.
4870	1355496045978	5	leneight ratingfive i thought a keyboard was just a keyboard.
4871	1355496045978	5	lentwentyone ratingfive from the second i am started typing on swiftkey 3 i was amazed at how much quickly i got comfortable with it.
4872	1355496045978	5	lenfive ratingfive sorry, can only give 5 stars.
4873	1355494271477	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i'd love to see the option to enable a dedicated number row though, for those of us with those huge phones.
4874	1355494095409	4	lensix ratingfour just add emojis and more themes.
4875	1355492326460	4	lentwentythree ratingfour it's a great keyboard! :-)  would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
4876	1355489105730	5	lenseventeen ratingfive this app has saved me over 10k keystrokes according to its statistics since i bought it 4 months ago!
4877	1355489105730	5	lentwenty ratingfive once i got used the to the interface i really don't know how i could live without it now!
4878	1355485717134	5	leneighteen ratingfive would like s pen support for galaxy note 2 so i don't have to swap when writing documents.
4879	1355485108510	3	lensix ratingthree not so good compare to swiftkey 1.
4880	1355485108510	3	lenten ratingthree or maybe it's this samsung galaxy 3 i'm using.
4881	1355485108510	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree had swiftkey 1 with my htc desire hd the swiftkey keyboard appeared with the prediction bar when i'm on the internet browser.
4882	1355485108510	3	lenthirteen ratingthree but the predictions bar doesn't appear for for the samsung at all.
4883	1355485108510	3	lenthirteen ratingthree and when i'm typing rapidly and trying to press the space button.
4884	1355484247796	2	lensixteen ratingtwo whenever i try to enter a search term this app seems to stop working all together.
4885	1355476899322	5	leneight ratingfive samsung swipe keyboard used to be great on s1.
4886	1355476899322	5	lenseven ratingfive useless now on s3 so bought this app.
4887	1355476899322	5	lenten ratingfive next word prediction is spooky -  almost predicts the entire sentence!
4888	1355476260128	3	lenseven ratingthree really makes my phone sluggish whilst installed
4889	1355475161850	5	lennine ratingfive i was surprised at how well this keyboard worked.
4890	1355475161850	5	lenseven ratingfive predictions and accuracy are second to none.
4891	1355475161850	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i got this during one of the holiday discounts but i would have gladly paid full price.
4892	1355473528121	5	leneleven ratingfive no problems, quick to learn, and will learn how you type.
4893	1355470479261	5	lenfive ratingfive swiftkey word predictions is amazing.
4894	1355470479261	5	leneighteen ratingfive what i love the most is that it learns the words in my own language that i typed.
4895	1355470479261	5	lenseven ratingfive my local words also appear as predictions.
4896	1355470479261	5	lenseven ratingfive wish for more keyboard themes to come.
4897	1355470479261	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every cent.
4898	1355469882467	5	lentwentysix ratingfive love this keyboard and just got the update to jb on my evolte and was wondering if you guys were implementing emoji support for the keyboard?
4899	1355467168864	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i love to text quickly and sometimes i make small errors in keystrokes.
4900	1355467168864	5	leneight ratingfive this keyboard corrects and predicts my text perfectly.
4901	1355467168864	5	leneleven ratingfive typing on my mobile has never been so easy or efficient.
4902	1355467168864	5	lenfive ratingfive worth every cent and more.
4903	1355466050065	3	lentwo ratingthree emoji support.
4904	1355466050065	3	lenseven ratingthree why doesn't any keyboard have emoticons?
4905	1355466050065	3	lensix ratingthree surely its not hard to do.
4906	1355464882981	1	lentwelve ratingone can't believe i need to pay again for the tablet version.
4907	1355464882981	1	lentwo ratingone money sucker.
4908	1355460517795	4	lentwentysix ratingfour this keyboard is amazing but the only problem i have with it is that when i use google drive it slows down and lags so much.
4909	1355458520932	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this app!
4910	1355458520932	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny!
4911	1355458520932	5	lenseven ratingfive i just wish they would add swipe
4912	1355457943165	5	leneleven ratingfive perfect to replace the crappy auto correct that comes with the s3.
4913	1355457677796	5	lentwelve ratingfive been using since beta, best keyboard app out there with this release.
4914	1355457677796	5	lennineteen ratingfive would like to see a couple more themes, but i have no complaints as the holo theme is gorgeous.
4915	1355455714860	5	lensix ratingfive puts the stock autocorrect to shame! !
4916	1355455714860	5	lensix ratingfive well worth the money to upgrade.
4917	1355455702988	5	lenfive ratingfive this keyboard works amazingly well!
4918	1355455702988	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive it's making me a lazy texter as i don't have to get many letter right in a word for it to correct it correctly, it works better than anything i've ever tried.
4919	1355454749946	5	lennine ratingfive been looking for a new keyboard with more options.
4920	1355452039732	5	lenfive ratingfive no complaints for this keyboard.
4921	1355451390342	4	lentwentythree ratingfour i think it provides a great writing experience, but it slows down my overall smartphone readiness and needs an huge amount of ram.
4922	1355451390342	4	lenfive ratingfour a ridiculous amount of ram!
4923	1355451390342	4	lentwo ratingfour absolutely disappointing!
4924	1355451390342	4	lenseven ratingfour fix that and you would reach perfection!
4925	1355451390342	4	lentwo ratingfour definitely perfection!
4926	1355449043312	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i'm faster on this than i am on my computer, in fact in took me a couple seconds to write this.
4927	1355449043312	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i find that i can type without looking at the keyboard which is amazing.
4928	1355448318017	5	lenfive ratingfive trust me money well spent.
4929	1355448318017	5	lennine ratingfive it freaky how it knows what you want type.
4930	1355448318017	5	lenten ratingfive i want it work on my lap top same way!
4931	1355445491764	5	lenthirtyseven ratingfive i haven't used this keyboard in awhile due to being satisfied with the jellybean keyboard on my galaxy nexus, however since getting the razr m i've started to look for alternatives and stopped at swiftkey.
4932	1355445491764	5	lensix ratingfive can't wait for swiftkey flow.
4933	1355442774653	5	lenseven ratingfive the new flow option is also awesome.
4934	1355442774653	5	lenfive ratingfive you won't regret it!
4935	1355441101006	3	lenfourteen ratingthree please provide swipe support like the latest keyboard update provided by google for nexus.
4936	1355441101006	3	lenten ratingthree without that, you might be left behind in the race.
4937	1355441048146	3	lenthirteen ratingthree when ever i enter my email address the auto space messes shot up.
4938	1355441048146	3	leneighteen ratingthree lack of hand writing support for the note 2 is a shame, will inable again when this is supported.
4939	1355441048146	3	lennine ratingthree loved swiftkey3 on my evo hate it on the note
4940	1355608275536	5	lentwelve ratingfive you can spell something completely wrong but it knows what you meant.
4941	1355608221592	5	lenseventeen ratingfive fiddly to start with but it's scary how it works out works out what you typing
4942	1355607134169	3	leneighteen ratingthree this is my favourite keyboard of all time except for one extremely annoying bug and one minor one.
4943	1355607134169	3	lenfifteen ratingthree 1 - the keyboard reverts to the original android keyboard every time the usb storage becomes disconnected.
4944	1355607134169	3	lentwentysix ratingthree every time i hook up to the computer or shut down the phone and restart, i have to re-enable it via the android os settings.
4945	1355607134169	3	lentwo ratingthree extremely annoying.
4946	1355607134169	3	lennine ratingthree fix this and it will be a 4 star application.
4947	1355607134169	3	leneight ratingthree 2 - the keyboard remembers much of what is typed.
4948	1355607134169	3	lentwentythree ratingthree great in most circumstances, but when sending odometer readings via text for tracking purposes, there's no reason for it to track it.
4949	1355607134169	3	lennineteen ratingthree numbers, for the most part, could probably be ignored or at least give us the option to ignore them.
4950	1355607134169	3	lenfourteen ratingthree i don't need it suggesting an odometer reading i'll never see again.
4951	1355607134169	3	lentwentyone ratingthree it would also be nice to be able to edit the remembered words and add or remove words, especially in multiples.
4952	1355606214638	4	lentwo ratingfour amazing keyboard.
4953	1355606214638	4	leneight ratingfour but could you guys add a swiping option?
4954	1355606214638	4	lensixteen ratingfour that's the only thing keeping me from leaving swype and going back to this one.
4955	1355606067107	4	leneight ratingfour loving flow beta, it'll only get better.
4956	1355605717338	3	lentwentyone ratingthree if i take the time to manually capitalize letters and add apostrophes, etc, then swiftkey shouldn't try to change it.
4957	1355604653095	1	lensix ratingone needs improvement in arabic language support
4958	1355595682742	5	lensix ratingfive works great compared to stock keyboard.
4959	1355593804520	4	lenten ratingfour i have been using the keyboard for several months now.
4960	1355593804520	4	lensixteen ratingfour after time, it learns how you type & practically knows what you are going to type next.
4961	1355593804520	4	lenfour ratingfour makes it so easy!
4962	1355593804520	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour my only wish is the ability to add words to dictionary & more keyboard options with symbols like hearts that come standard on most samsung galaxy s3
4963	1355593689237	5	lenseventeen ratingfive a friend told me about it,  and how it almost reads your mind while you are typing.
4964	1355593689237	5	leneleven ratingfive then i read a review here that said the same thing.
4965	1355593689237	5	leneleven ratingfive so i tried it, and it's nothing short of incredible.
4966	1355593689237	5	lenseventeen ratingfive not flawless, but much better than anything else out there like swype, better keyboard, or androids stock.
4967	1355593689237	5	lenthree ratingfive worth the money.
4968	1355592561627	5	lentwenty ratingfive i bought the full version of this almost a year ago for my wife and i and we love it!
4969	1355592561627	5	lennineteen ratingfive the only weird thing i encountered was on my razr while it's charging the keyboard acts very weird.
4970	1355592561627	5	lenfifteen ratingfive don't know of its the phone or the app, regardless i love this keyboard! :-)
4971	1355591265605	5	lenthirteen ratingfive had issues earlier with it freezing, but it seems to work great now.
4972	1355590136298	5	lenthree ratingfive need say more?
4973	1355589657503	5	lenfour ratingfive the most accurate keyboard!
4974	1355588711974	5	lentwelve ratingfive amazing app, although i wish there were more themes to choose from.
4975	1355586117378	4	lenseventeen ratingfour it doesn't allow you to use the prediction features on text fields that already have it.
4976	1355586117378	4	lentwenty ratingfour an example is when you type something on google search app, you're abandoned to the slow typing process again.
4977	1355586117378	4	lenfifteen ratingfour the same happens in some contact names fields such as gmail, gosms pro, any.do.
4978	1355585159034	5	lentwentythree ratingfive builtin android keyboard are good, but sincerely we need a more productive and less error prone virtual keyboard solution: and here it is.
4979	1355580277633	2	lensixtyfive ratingtwo i was not happy with the keyboard after coming from iphone to android until i tried swiftkey, however, i have  found quite a few apps that refuse to show the predictive text.like the built in browser on my galaxy s3 and way more update; giving up until they fix predictive text and make keyboard thy doesn't have all th keys basically touching each other.
4980	1355580277633	2	lenten ratingtwo try smart keyboard instead.iphone still > android for keyboard unfortunately.
4981	1355579060010	5	leneight ratingfive learns my typing style and predicts common phrases.
4982	1355579060010	5	lenfour ratingfive soo worth the download!
4983	1355577919990	5	lentwelve ratingfive great work, learns from all your mistakes and knows its grammar too.
4984	1355573352394	5	leneleven ratingfive works really well and detect next potential word that makes sense
4985	1355569778851	1	lenthree ratingone version 2 was perfect.
4986	1355569778851	1	lenfour ratingone version 3 is just bad !
4987	1355569778851	1	lenfourteen ratingone whenever i wanna use the sign () it always write wrong and impossible to use.
4988	1355569778851	1	leneleven ratingone many people try to contact and complain but nobody answer there !
4989	1355569778851	1	lenten ratingone i have tried to ask if possible to add "numbers"
4990	1355569778851	1	lennineteen ratingone on top of the keyboard like on samsung original keyboard and they sent me to write on their blog.
4991	1355569778851	1	lensix ratingone but no one answer, nobody care.
4992	1355569778851	1	leneleven ratingone when they became good, they just ignore the customers at all.
4993	1355569778851	1	lenseven ratingone i wish i wouldn't pay them !
4994	1355569778851	1	lenfifteen ratingone after a yer of disappointment and ignorant i am going back to the stock keyboard .
4995	1355569778851	1	lennineteen ratingone p.s. it help to correct mistakes but in the stock keyboard i dont get any mistakes at all.
4996	1355568052205	5	lentwenty ratingfive replaced the go keyboard with this and haven't looked back,  there isn't a thing i don't like.
4997	1355568052205	5	lentwentysix ratingfive the predictive text is genius,  the keys are able to be made larger and i don't constantly hit the wrong ones like on the go.
4998	1355568052205	5	lensixteen ratingfive this is the first app i've paid for and it's well worth the money.
4999	1355566901673	4	lentwenty ratingfour i'm using the trial keyboard, but can't miss the sale off :), buy it and waiting for vietnamese language.
5000	1355564787190	5	lenseventeen ratingfive great this is the best keyboard i've used and the only one i'll ever use.
5001	1355563798086	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i have a g2 and i don't even remember that it has a keyboard.
5002	1355555247980	5	lentwo ratingfive absolutely beautiful.
5003	1355552122303	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i got so frustrated with my keyboard that i bought this without thinking.
5004	1355552122303	4	lennine ratingfour all through its not perfect, its close to it.
5005	1355552122303	4	lentwentyone ratingfour i would really like to see more customization like more keyboard clolors and maybe some emoj that's different from iphone.
5006	1355550708923	4	leneleven ratingfour would you be able to make an update with vietnamese language?
5007	1355549992137	2	lenten ratingtwo this keyboard is good but it really needs more theme.
5008	1355549992137	2	lennine ratingtwo just at least one of all the major colors.
5009	1355549992137	2	lentwo ratingtwo especially red!
5010	1355548157873	4	lentwelve ratingfour please made available for moving app to rom for faster keyboard entries
5011	1355547461808	1	lentwentynine ratingone it always adds spaces after full stops, and adds unwanted words after commas, i wish i hadn't paid for this before i knew there was a free version
5012	1355547163380	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this is by far the best and most user friendly keyboard on the market.
5013	1355542636878	5	leneleven ratingfive this is a great app to replace your current keyboard with!
5014	1355542148963	5	lennine ratingfive this is the best and most intuitive keyboard going.
5015	1355542148963	5	lentwenty ratingfive i use it with english and deutsch loaded and it flawlessly swaps between them as i try and go bilingual.
5016	1355541907700	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo have turned off as does not support pen entered text on samsung note 2.
5017	1355541907700	2	leneight ratingtwo the samsung predictive text is catching up though.
5018	1355541907700	2	lenten ratingtwo have turned off as note ii does not work properly.
5019	1355541907700	2	lentwentysix ratingtwo if you are not going to fix it then make it assignable to applications so it can be ignored for apps where it doesn't work.
5020	1355538153594	3	lenfive ratingthree i want more color fonts
5021	1355534900337	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i have bought very few apps, and am very stingy when buying one, but after using the trial version im pretty much sold!
5022	1355534900337	5	lennineteen ratingfive if you're dyslexic or just have fat thumbs (both of which i have), this is great for texting!
5023	1355534900337	5	lenthree ratingfive def worth 4 dollars!
5024	1355530662927	3	lensix ratingthree why is there no tab key?
5025	1355530315256	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i don't even have to finish a word and the app does the rest!
5026	1355530315256	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i wrote this review with this app not having to type any whole word!
5027	1355529364057	3	leneight ratingthree when it comes to writing, it's flawless.
5028	1355529364057	3	lentwentyeight ratingthree but when i have to put numbers into a password or messaging someone and using numbers the numbers come out jumbled, please look into this, sent from my gs3
5029	1355526149795	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this keyboard.
5030	1355526149795	5	lentwentysix ratingfive i'm very used to having an iphone and the only thing i didn't like about the galaxy s3 when i switched over was the keyboard.
5031	1355526149795	5	leneight ratingfive with this swift keyboard i am completely happy.
5032	1355523663494	5	lennine ratingfive this is a really great program i love it.
5033	1355692250712	5	leneighteen ratingfive i had a bb before and was so used to feeling the keypad, and it felt weird using s3.
5034	1355692250712	5	lentwentyone ratingfive but i've downloaded this app as soon as i bought the phone and it has made my typing waaaay easier.
5035	1355692250712	5	lentwentyone ratingfive it now predicts the words i want and i usually type fast and in shorthand, and it has learned from me.
5036	1355692250712	5	leneight ratingfive love this app and reccomend it to everybody!
5037	1355688152640	5	lenfifteen ratingfive one of the reasons why i've stuck to ios is because of the keyboard.
5038	1355688152640	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i've always found the stock keyboard to be acceptable but not great.
5039	1355688152640	5	leneight ratingfive this app is amazing and worth the cost.
5040	1355688152640	5	lentwentyone ratingfive for less than what you'll spend at a gourmet coffee shop you'll save time and frustration using this app.
5041	1355688152640	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommend
5042	1355687781710	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i  love this keyboard, although sometimes i get into a fight with the text predictions changing what i'm trying to say.
5043	1355687781710	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i would like it if there were emoticon add ons for this keyboard like there are some of the other ones though.
5044	1355687043047	3	leneleven ratingthree sometimes doesn't work and i have to uninstall and reinstall.
5045	1355687043047	3	lentwo ratingthree otherwise fantastic.
5046	1355685846014	3	lentwentysix ratingthree this app is okay except that the keys are loud when i type, so if i'm working or hunting i have to change the settings.
5047	1355685846014	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree and if i'm just not finding how to change the setting i apologize but i've looked everywhere on the phone
5048	1355685812856	4	lenthree ratingfour needs more themes!
5049	1355684991529	5	leneight ratingfive i'm so glad i bought this app.
5050	1355684991529	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i did the free trial first, and then decided not to get the full version.
5051	1355684991529	5	lenten ratingfive within an hour i was going nuts without swift key!
5052	1355684991529	5	lensixteen ratingfive i could not go back to the regular keyboard i had prior to trying out swiftkey!
5053	1355684991529	5	lensix ratingfive u will definitely not regret it!
5054	1355684991529	5	lenthree ratingfive worth the money!
5055	1355683269190	5	lenfive ratingfive writes in your personal style.
5056	1355683269190	5	lensixteen ratingfive can be as slapdash as you want and still type effortlessly and still save time/strokes.
5057	1355682046826	4	lensix ratingfour this has really helped my accuracy.
5058	1355682046826	4	lenthree ratingfour love the ".com"
5059	1355682046826	4	lenten ratingfour button but i wish it were in a different place.
5060	1355682046826	4	leneleven ratingfour maybe put it on the left side of the space bar.
5061	1355680439143	2	lenfour ratingtwo you need more themes.
5062	1355680439143	2	lenseven ratingtwo i'm about to drop this keyboard.
5063	1355680439143	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo it's a great keyboard,  i just get board with the limited options
5064	1355678530711	1	leneight ratingone it's useless application with jelly bean keyboard.
5065	1355678530711	1	lentwelve ratingone company does not take responsibility of refund when consumer is not satisfied
5066	1355678235908	5	lentwenty ratingfive used to work perfect but after i had accidentally deleted it, can't get it to work again after reinstall.
5067	1355675483178	4	lensixteen ratingfour in the dvorak layout, the lowercase 'm' & 'w' keys are supposed to display '(' & ')' on long press.
5068	1355675483178	4	lennine ratingfour the 'w' usually displays a '0' instead, but occasionally readjusts.
5069	1355672746633	1	lenthirteen ratingone this would have been a 4 star but the inability to hide the "com"
5070	1355672746633	1	lennine ratingone button while in a browser renders it nearly useless.
5071	1355672746633	1	lentwelve ratingone hit it all the time when trying to hit the space bar.
5072	1355662423371	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive use this keyboard all the time it's like it reads my mind with words great app best on android market must have thanks people :-)
5073	1355654349633	5	lenten ratingfive unbelievably accurate in predicting and it really evolves with use.
5074	1355654349633	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive it even learnt and now predicts words and phrases in my mother tongue which is not english and which is also not available for downloading.
5075	1355654349633	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i found it so good that i even bought it for my tablet.
5076	1355654349633	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i recommended this app to my friends also and now they love it as well.
5077	1355654349633	5	lensixteen ratingfive now i just need my wife to make the switch to android from her crappy nokia.
5078	1355654349633	5	lensix ratingfive officially my favorite app for android.
5079	1355644548267	5	lenten ratingfive feels amazing too, but lots better than the samsung keyboard.
5080	1355644430806	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive i'll lower my rating to 4 stars since the jelly bean bug resetting the keyboard to stock at each reboot has been around for long without being fixed.
5081	1355644430806	5	leneight ratingfive cept for that this is my favorite keyboard.
5082	1355639168335	5	lenfive ratingfive this app is very handy.
5083	1355639168335	5	lenten ratingfive the keyboard works nicely and truly evolves around your grammar.
5084	1355639168335	5	lensixteen ratingfive there are so many things you can tweak as well such as prediction invoking and theme.
5085	1355639168335	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i wouldn't be say it is a must have app, but it is a great improvement over the default keyboard.
5086	1355635213070	5	lenfifteen ratingfive we all use it every day so might as well invest on a good one.
5087	1355635061771	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour this typing app is amazing, and i was sitting on the fence whether to buy it or not and i'm glad i did!
5088	1355635061771	4	lentwelve ratingfour the s 3 keyboard would miss about 20% of the words i miss typed.
5089	1355635061771	4	lennine ratingfour i this hasn't missed a single one yet.
5090	1355635061771	4	lenfifteen ratingfour i the only reason i give it a 4 is because there is no swipe texting.
5091	1355634663265	4	lensixteen ratingfour definitely worth the purchase :)  would you be able to make an update with vietnamese language though?
5092	1355634663265	4	lennine ratingfour then this would be the most perfect keyboard ever!
5093	1355632932685	5	leneight ratingfive this keyboard is the boss of all keyboards.
5094	1355632932685	5	lenten ratingfive just hope they continue to make it more battery efficient.
5095	1355629563756	5	lensix ratingfive it is such a great app!
5096	1355629563756	5	lennineteen ratingfive i thought i lost my texting when i gave up my blackberry but this just gave it all back.
5097	1355629563756	5	lenseven ratingfive now i'm using the flow beta.
5098	1355629563756	5	lentwelve ratingfive to be able to text and flow at the same time awesome!
5099	1355629563756	5	lennineteen ratingfive this is the first and only paid app i have on my phone and it was worth every penny.
5100	1355627013450	5	lennine ratingfive fell in love with swiftkey during the trial period.
5101	1355627013450	5	lenseven ratingfive i bought the app during thanksgiving sale!
5102	1355627013450	5	lenthree ratingfive totally worth it.
5103	1355626607843	5	lensix ratingfive simply the best application ever used
5104	1355622955447	3	lenfourteen ratingthree so far this key pad has been the best and i recomend it highly
5105	1355616922452	5	lenseven ratingfive this app makes typing a pleasant experience:-)!
5106	1355614607571	5	lenfour ratingfive fast, quick and accurate.
5107	1355614607571	5	lenten ratingfive money well spent, switch from swipe to swift, no regrets!
5108	1355781704915	5	leneighteen ratingfive took a little while to get it just how i wanted but will never change it now,  great
5109	1355779891013	4	lentwentyeight ratingfour just wish there were more themes to choose from and that of your backspace from an auto completed word that it would defer to what you originally typed.
5110	1355779774696	4	lenten ratingfour as stated before swiftkey does not load after a reboot.
5111	1355779774696	4	lennine ratingfour it has to be disabled an re enable again.
5112	1355779774696	4	leneight ratingfour please try to fix as soon as possible.
5113	1355779774696	4	leneight ratingfour device is a galaxy s 3 mini running 4.1.1 thanks.
5114	1355779485210	5	lensixteen ratingfive moved to a new phone without physical keyboard and swiftkey is now my preferred keyboard again
5115	1355779436945	4	lenfourteen ratingfour great keyboard and prediction but needs swipe function for portrait mode and better customization
5116	1355778466839	3	lentwelve ratingthree this app is probably the most important one you will ever download.
5117	1355778466839	3	lenfifteen ratingthree i am using it to type right now and it is basically reading my mind.
5118	1355778466839	3	lennine ratingthree this is the reason i stopped considering the iphone.
5119	1355778466839	3	leneight ratingthree i have shown so many people this keyboard.
5120	1355778466839	3	lentwentythree ratingthree update: using on the lg optimus g and the cursor keeps  jumping to the top of the field in the middle of sentences.
5121	1355778460186	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard!
5122	1355776803451	4	lenfour ratingfour maybe i'm wrong.
5123	1355776803451	4	lensix ratingfour but can't personalized with fb.
5124	1355776803451	4	lenfive ratingfour maybe cause fb now changed.
5125	1355775181942	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour uninstalled until i can save it to the sd card, everything is great except for the amount of space it takes up.
5126	1355773316910	4	lenfourteen ratingfour this app is very good, but it can run a little laggy on my gs3
5127	1355766705107	4	lenfifteen ratingfour this app has definitely improved my texting speed and accuracy, and i thought that impossible.
5128	1355766705107	4	lenten ratingfour the prediction is first class and gets better with time.
5129	1355766705107	4	leneight ratingfour give me a red version of the "holo"
5130	1355766705107	4	lensix ratingfour theme and you'll get 5 stars.
5131	1355766386446	5	lenfive ratingfive i love this keyboard app.
5132	1355766386446	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i'm a fast txter and love that this responds very well with minium errors.
5133	1355766386446	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive the only thing i do hate is when i enter a full stop then  space it automatically in puts (i) so my sentences start with i when i'm typing fast.
5134	1355765981392	5	lentwo ratingfive simply amazing
5135	1355764991901	5	lenthree ratingfive touchtype made easy
5136	1355753943810	1	lennineteen ratingone used to be the best keyboard ever since jellybean update now on my gs3 it will not hold as default :'-(
5137	1355752400744	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i would love to more themes, the current themes are great but i love customising my phone.
5138	1355751230543	1	lenseven ratingone cant do anything with a paid app.
5139	1355751230543	1	lenfive ratingone i want my money back
5140	1355744407871	4	lenfour ratingfour wheres the clipboard button?
5141	1355742531627	5	lenfour ratingfive using version 3 since beta.
5142	1355742531627	5	lentwelve ratingfive predictions are amazing, sometimes writing whole sentence takes just a few clicks!
5143	1355742531627	5	lenseventeen ratingfive and even if you are not using predictions typing on this keyboard is very fast and precise.
5144	1355742531627	5	lenfour ratingfive lots of customization options.
5145	1355742531627	5	lentwelve ratingfive the must have for every android user (except you prefer swype keyboard).
5146	1355742322886	5	lennine ratingfive this by far the best keyboard seen on earth .
5147	1355741112904	5	lentwelve ratingfive great, love how it corrects it but leaves the words you want.
5148	1355741112904	5	lentwo ratingfive five stars.
5149	1355737728968	5	lenfive ratingfive and flow is even better!
5150	1355737728968	5	lenthirteen ratingfive can't wait for it to come out in it's final version
5151	1355734536139	5	lenthirteen ratingfive before i installed this, i was not tying sentences that looked like this.
5152	1355734536139	5	lentwenty ratingfive instesg i wa[ teing oned that liiled like thws.  thank you swift key for putting my keyboard back together again!
5153	1355731362826	1	lensix ratingone this auto correct is illogical sometimes.
5154	1355731362826	1	lenfive ratingone i don't mean "justified".
5155	1355731362826	1	lenthirteen ratingone it will also auto capitalize words that don't need to be capitalized.
5156	1355731362826	1	lenfifteen ratingone it takes more time to teach this app and correct its mistakes than its worth.
5157	1355730469313	3	lenfifteen ratingthree was excellent but pasting has recently broken on my samsung galaxy s3 which is very frustrating!
5158	1355730469313	3	leneight ratingthree please fix asap, i've paid for this!
5159	1355728538577	2	lenthirtynine ratingtwo i don't know what sort of processor is expected for running a keyboard but swift key can't keep up with my typing for the most part on a samsung galaxy tablet 10.1  the prediction is very good however.
5160	1355728067023	5	lensix ratingfive best app purchase i've made.
5161	1355728067023	5	lensixteen ratingfive very easy to type (much easier than the standard keyboard),  and word prediction is uncannily accurate.
5162	1355724433785	4	lentwo ratingfour phenomenal keyboard.
5163	1355724433785	4	lenfive ratingfour gets better with every update.
5164	1355724433785	4	lenthirtyone ratingfour only suggestions i have would be a tab key for use with web browsers and such and a personal dictionary would be nice to help speed the keyboards learning process up
5165	1355724304335	3	lentwentyfour ratingthree getting better with follow but little things like the width of the back button and suggestions made by touchpal make their keyboard much better.
5166	1355724195778	5	lentwelve ratingfive this was already the best keyboard out and then they added flow.
5167	1355724195778	5	lenfour ratingfive icing on the cake
5168	1355723523584	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i can't believe that i typed this whole comment and only pressed 23 letters!
5169	1355723523584	5	lenfive ratingfive it's worth the price.
5170	1355723523584	5	lensixteen ratingfive excellent keyboard and i think it should come stock with new android phones right beside swype.
5171	1355723129271	5	lennineteen ratingfive i'm so glad i tried the trial and after a hour of using the app i purchased it.
5172	1355723129271	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i would highly recommend this over the junk keyboard that comes with the same 3.
5173	1355723129271	5	lenfour ratingfive 5 stars in my book!
5174	1355722437800	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it's the best keyboard and now i cannot just type without it.
5175	1355722437800	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i never go and comment about an app but this app made me do it.
5176	1355722437800	5	lensix ratingfive please add a few themes frequently.
5177	1355721514686	1	leneighteen ratingone i love this keyboard,  but i notice a significant decrease in my battery life when i use it.
5178	1355721514686	1	lentwelve ratingone please fix this so i can use this great keyboard once again.
5179	1355721443761	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny!
5180	1355721360221	5	lensix ratingfive it works wondrous, and learns quick.
5181	1355719293372	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this keyboard!
5182	1355719293372	5	lenten ratingfive i actually can type without looking at the phone sometime.
5183	1355719293372	5	lenten ratingfive it would be perfect if there was a delete key!
5184	1355718454635	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo i would give it 5 stars if predictive text was supported in all apps.
5185	1355718454635	2	leneight ratingtwo as it stands, too many apps remain unsupported.
5186	1355718454635	2	leneight ratingtwo switching back to note 2 default keyboard for now.
5187	1355707854406	5	lenseventeen ratingfive changed back to 5 stars since the notification that wouldn't go away appears to be a "feature"
5188	1355707854406	5	lenfive ratingfive in newer versions of android.
5189	1355706853317	5	lenseven ratingfive love it but needs emoji support now
5190	1355703099558	2	lentwentyfive ratingtwo pretty good,  i get sick of checking everything to make sure it's predicting what i actually wanted, it seems to lag a lot too
5191	1355700989560	5	lensix ratingfive just wish it had more themes.
5192	1355700989560	5	lentwelve ratingfive one like holo but red in place of the blue would rock.
5193	1355700377714	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this is the best keyboard i ever used and the only one i bought.
5194	1355700377714	5	lennine ratingfive only thing is it couldn't input chinese language.
5195	1355700093036	5	lenten ratingfive much better than the standard android one on the galaxy s3
5196	1355697280926	5	lenthirtythree ratingfive i love this app best $3 i've ever spent drastically increases texting speed if you have it set up right could use some more themes like a black background with neon green letters
5197	1355696974241	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive the one and only problem i have is this program needs to do a better with choosing which punctuation sentences should receive.
5198	1355696974241	5	lenthree ratingfive but overall, 5 stars
5199	1355696377608	5	leneighteen ratingfive don't know if this thing is too good to be true, but so far it's amazing.
5200	1355696377608	5	leneight ratingfive easily the best keyboard i have ever used
5201	1355867434439	5	lenfiftythree ratingfive i didn't like the new android keyboard when i got my galaxy s3 and all of the other keyboards were too touchy and just wasn't easy for me to type on than i discovered swift key and it made my typing experience so much better i can now type easy and freely.
5202	1355867434439	5	lenten ratingfive it also has a lot of neat features on here.
5203	1355866365717	4	lenseven ratingfour i write a lot of hindi words.
5204	1355866365717	4	leneleven ratingfour and i want swift key to save the words i type.
5205	1355865397966	5	lenfifteen ratingfive this is the first app i always download when i get a new android device.
5206	1355865397966	5	lentwelve ratingfive best & most intuitive keyboard for android always better than the stock one.
5207	1355865397966	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny.
5208	1355865234445	5	lenfour ratingfive really enjoy this keyboard.
5209	1355865234445	5	leneleven ratingfive as i'm a rapid tester it predicts things pretty good!
5210	1355865234445	5	lenten ratingfive i think it could do with a bit more customization.
5211	1355865234445	5	lentwenty ratingfive and a few more settings for example, after i insert specific types of punctuation it sometimes put a space after.
5212	1355865234445	5	lentwentysix ratingfive also another good one is being able to make the space bar bigger by removing the smiley key on the bottom right making the keyboard bigger.
5213	1355865234445	5	leneight ratingfive but over all,  it's a great app!
5214	1355864225706	4	lentwelve ratingfour i really would like to see chinese language integration to be developed.
5215	1355864225706	4	leneight ratingfour very annoying to switch with other input methods.
5216	1355862694387	5	lensixteen ratingfive this is the very first keyboard i have lovec to much i had to buy it.
5217	1355862694387	5	leneight ratingfive thank you all for such a great app.
5218	1355862389762	1	lennine ratingone does not work with s-pen on galaxy note 2
5219	1355862090484	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i love the keyboards and what not it looks so awesome but just need some more themes to choose from or more customization choices.
5220	1355861667816	5	lentwelve ratingfive takes them ages to fix new features that they foist on you.
5221	1355861667816	5	lenfourteen ratingfive last time it was smileys/predictions without spaces messing up other languages than english.
5222	1355861667816	5	lennineteen ratingfive i'm so not looking forward to the new swype update that will most likely break swipe to delete.
5223	1355858801050	5	lenfive ratingfive best keyboard for the price.
5224	1355858801050	5	lentwelve ratingfive if you want a free version right now, go get swiftkey flow!
5225	1355855810864	5	lenfive ratingfive love it on my gsiii.
5226	1355854057027	5	lentwenty ratingfive this app helps me improve how typing on my galaxy nexus so much, btw i typed this on like 10 seconds.
5227	1355850066780	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i really enjoyed being able to drag and type but this smart keyboard is unbelievable.
5228	1355850066780	5	lentwelve ratingfive it works so well and intuitively i would recommend it to anyone.
5229	1355850066780	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome app.
5230	1355850066780	5	lenten ratingfive worth the purchase price especially with the audio typing option
5231	1355850046019	5	lenten ratingfive fantastic application it really ups your typing skills love it.
5232	1355849198247	5	lentwenty ratingfive used to work perfect but after i had accidentally deleted it, can't get it to work again after reinstall.
5233	1355846926125	1	leneight ratingone it was awesome until the layout was changed.
5234	1355846926125	1	lenthirteen ratingone it may work for large displays but not phones with cases on them!
5235	1355846926125	1	lenseven ratingone i hate the new slide punctuation bar!
5236	1355846926125	1	lenfive ratingone bring smaller space bar back!
5237	1355846926125	1	lentwelve ratingone i hate how it adds .'s & ,'s in the word prediction bar.
5238	1355846926125	1	leneleven ratingone i uninstalled and went back to version 2.2.0.159, much better than update!
5239	1355846926125	1	lenfourteen ratingone you need to add something to allow us to edit the prediction word database.
5240	1355846926125	1	lenten ratingone this way, we can manually erase unwanted crap, periods & commas!
5241	1355845930947	1	lenthirtyseven ratingone update: hi, i'm swiftkey and i like to enter random as$ words you never, ever knew you wanted me to type after commas and whatever else i feel like because i can predict the future, buddy.
5242	1355845930947	1	lentwenty ratingone even better, you have to backspace through the always wrong, never correct text insertions that happen automatically letter by letter.
5243	1355845930947	1	lennine ratingone i don't remember turning anything like this on.
5244	1355845930947	1	lentwentytwo ratingone this app is now useless, i have since switched back to the stock keyboard awaiting further updates that correct these useless corrections.
5245	1355845930947	1	lensixteen ratingone ~~~old review follows~~~  a separate tablet app i have to purchase in addition to regular swiftkey?
5246	1355845930947	1	lentwelve ratingone otherwise an excellent keyboard with excellent predictive text and excellent spell check.
5247	1355845930947	1	leneleven ratingone there is a very slight slowdown while typing at times though.
5248	1355845930947	1	lensixteen ratingone not sure what is causing it but fix that and you will have pure keyboard perfection!
5249	1355843344236	5	lennineteen ratingfive i run this on all my android devices (both tab and phones) and will never go back to stock.
5250	1355834267264	3	lentwentyseven ratingthree when your in messages and lock the screen, once you turn it back on the suggestions are gone and you have to close and re open swiftkey.
5251	1355834267264	3	lennine ratingthree if this bug is fixed ill give this 5 stars
5252	1355833060399	1	lentwentythree ratingone everytime i turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and i have to keep activating this one.
5253	1355831117089	3	lenten ratingthree great app but without emoji support its only sub par
5254	1355828640879	5	leneleven ratingfive awesome :-)   this is the best keyboard in the whole app store.
5255	1355827023001	5	lentwenty ratingfive took me a while to find out the right settings for me and personalise them but really like it now.
5256	1355824872330	3	lenthree ratingthree galaxy s3, slowest keyboard.
5257	1355824872330	3	lennineteen ratingthree im not fond of the fact, i have to constantly switch to go keyboard for chinese either,  over rated.
5258	1355824762846	5	lenfourteen ratingfive its worth every cent. finally a keyboard that is beautiful and easy to use.
5259	1355824762846	5	leneight ratingfive detects different languages without swapping in the settings.
5260	1355822742935	4	lentwelve ratingfour i barely have to type, it knows what i want to say.
5261	1355822742935	4	leneleven ratingfour wish i could customize the layout, then i would give 5 stars.
5262	1355816826244	4	leneleven ratingfour awesome keyboard just lags with google takes forever to show up.
5263	1355816826244	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i like how you did pumpkin for halloween can we get a christmas theme.
5264	1355816321160	4	lensix ratingfour because of missing of macedonian language!
5265	1355813033301	5	lentwo ratingfive excellent app.
5266	1355812386240	3	lentwentytwo ratingthree ever since the jellybean update,  you have to exit the messaging application and open it up again for word prediction to work.
5267	1355812386240	3	lentwelve ratingthree i also don't like that you can't use swear words.
5268	1355812386240	3	lentwelve ratingthree i'm 23, please let me use what words i want to use.
5269	1355807058994	1	lentwelve ratingone i am tired of this fueling keyboard refusing to use swear words.
5270	1355807058994	1	lensix ratingone i didn't type fueling either.
5271	1355806313012	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i'm more of a precision typist but this app makes all the difference when typing quickly.
5272	1355806313012	5	lennine ratingfive i can't wait until swiftkey flow is released.
5273	1355806077601	5	lensix ratingfive shut up and take my money
5274	1355805946273	5	lenfifteen ratingfive only app i have every paid for and not just side loaded with an apk.
5275	1355805946273	5	lensix ratingfive thanks for such a great app
5276	1355805391573	4	lenseventysix ratingfour was my fav,paid & 1st apk installed everytime.but sam has similar predictive technology built in note2 keyboard now & imo does it better!swiftkey's has limited 3 words predicted for selection.sam has 4-28 or more predictions.the hidden gem's in samsung chinese ime keyboard.change tat setting to english & voila!works just like swiftkey with auto selection,except row of predicted words in top row drastically increased!standard sam keyboard has same tech but no auto selection.
5277	1355804280387	3	leneighteen ratingthree i find it terribly annoying that now the prediction bar, and corrections don't work 50% of the time.
5278	1355804280387	3	lenthirteen ratingthree i have to close the keyboard and then reopen for this to work.
5279	1355804280387	3	lenthirteen ratingthree also, i should be able to delete typos that have been presumed predictions.
5280	1355799485441	5	lenthree ratingfive swiftkey flow ftw!
5281	1355799394677	4	lenseven ratingfour this keyboard is an essential android app.
5282	1355799394677	4	lensix ratingfour can't imagine not using it.
5283	1355799394677	4	lentwo ratingfour emoji support.
5284	1355799394677	4	lenseventeen ratingfour if this language/font were to be added, swiftkey would win the award for best android app.
5285	1355798196049	5	lenfourteen ratingfive after having the language constantly failing to download, and now not downloading at all.
5286	1355798196049	5	lenseven ratingfive seems to be a waste if money.
5287	1355797535653	5	lentwo ratingfive great app.
5288	1355797535653	5	lenfifteen ratingfive but very glitchy on google chrome, keeps typing previous word when pressing the backspace key.
5289	1355795705631	5	lenseven ratingfive you have saved me so much frustration!
5290	1355795705631	5	lenfour ratingfive love love love this!
5291	1355795703519	4	leneight ratingfour only problem i have is the exclamation mark.
5292	1355795703519	4	lenfifteen ratingfour very very poor set up,  it almost never works when you swipe the multi button.
5293	1355795703519	4	leneleven ratingfour always puts a period or a comma, never an exclamation mark.
5294	1355795508400	5	leneight ratingfive saved me a lot of time and frustration.
5295	1355793425737	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive i have used and purchased almost all of the main brand keyboards out there, by far swift key has been the best at a fairly placed price.
5296	1355793425737	5	lennineteen ratingfive i have been using swift key for about a week now and i had already saved me 10,000 key strokes.
5297	1355793425737	5	lenfifteen ratingfive before typing would be boreing and now it's the best feature on my phone.
5298	1355793425737	5	lenseven ratingfive thanks swiftkey, keep up the good work.
5299	1355793148699	5	leneleven ratingfive i've been using this since i had my htc evo 3d.
5300	1355793148699	5	lenthirteen ratingfive used it on my galaxy note i and now on my note ii.
5301	1355793148699	5	lenten ratingfive however, now that the beta version of the new "flow"
5302	1355793148699	5	leneight ratingfive is available, i have since been using that.
5303	1355793148699	5	lennine ratingfive flow adds the greatness of regular skx with swype.
5304	1355791646839	5	lensix ratingfive helped improve my typing a ton.
5305	1355791646839	5	lennine ratingfive much faster and fixes my errors like none other.
5306	1355791174999	1	lentwelve ratingone until i updated to jelly bean, i would give this app 5 stars.
5307	1355791174999	1	lentwentyfive ratingone however, following the update on my s3 to jelly bean, it now reverts to the samsung keyboard as the default every time i restart the phone.
5308	1355791174999	1	lentwelve ratingone i downloaded another keyboard app and there is no problem with it.
5309	1355791174999	1	lentwentyseven ratingone from my understanding, it is an issue the developers are aware of and have stated that we all need to wait until jelly bean is updated to 4.1.2.
5310	1355791174999	1	lennineteen ratingone as far as i am concerned, that is unacceptable when it could clearly be resolved at the swiftkey level.
5311	1355791174999	1	lenten ratingone once resolved, i will go back to a 5-star rating.
5312	1355791174999	1	lenthirteen ratingone until then, i will be using another keyboard and rating this app 1-star.
5313	1355789660880	5	lensixteen ratingfive currently trying flow, which is wonderful, but this keyboard even without flow has always been perfect.
5314	1355789061151	4	lentwenty ratingfour very user friendly, great typo correction and i loooove the auto correct that can overcome accidentally missing the space bar.
5315	1355789061151	4	lenfour ratingfour i just need chinese!
5316	1355789061151	4	lenfifteen ratingfour otherwise it's such a pain to switch keyboards just to type one chinese character!
5317	1355787288724	2	lenthirty ratingtwo keeps rebooting vzw gnex and numerous bug reports and posts left unanswered or even unacknowledged using pay version too.not again back to swype least they try to support users
5318	1355785631671	5	lensixteen ratingfive i downloaded this and sent a total of two texts before i had to buy this.
5319	1355785631671	5	lensix ratingfive i suggest this to any phone.
5320	1355785631671	5	lensix ratingfive it honestly predicted this entire message.
5321	1355785368940	5	lenfour ratingfive best keyboard for android
5322	1356030620684	5	lentwentynine ratingfive amoung many great features, i especially like that rather than switching to numbers amd symbols,  (which you can,) you can hold key down, and selected # or smybol is inserted.
5323	1356030620684	5	lennine ratingfive this is honestly best keyboard i've ever used!
5324	1356030586668	5	lennine ratingfive predictions get better the longer you use the app.
5325	1356030586668	5	lenfour ratingfive definitely worth the cost.
5326	1356030559641	4	lennine ratingfour i can't stand not having a dedicated '?' key.
5327	1356030559641	4	lensix ratingfour love the update, minus that issue.
5328	1356030337598	5	lentwo ratingfive excellent layout.
5329	1356030337598	5	lenten ratingfive and speed but every update resets my personal word info.
5330	1356030337598	5	lenseventeen ratingfive please allow a backup and give us the option to add our own words with priority settings.
5331	1356030031411	5	lentwo ratingfive great app.
5332	1356030031411	5	lennine ratingfive just love it and can't function without it.
5333	1356030031411	5	lenten ratingfive perfect for people that regularly communicate in 2 languages or more.
5334	1356029585910	5	leneight ratingfive really a convenient keyboard which pampers your fingers.
5335	1356029515281	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i've tried every android keyboard and this one is the least intrusive in its design and the most intelligent in its prediction algo.
5336	1356029413557	5	lenthree ratingfive love this keyboard.
5337	1356029413557	5	lenfive ratingfive typing has never been easier!
5338	1356029354176	5	lenthree ratingfive love this keyboard
5339	1356011785098	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this keyboard!
5340	1356011679371	5	leneighteen ratingfive this app makes touch screen typing as good,  or dare i say better than the blackberry hard keyboard.
5341	1356011679371	5	lenseventeen ratingfive the auto correct and predictive auto fill are the best thing to ever happen to a phone.
5342	1356011679371	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive when i use my wife's iphone keyboard now,  it makes me want to smash it into pieces because it is so bad compared to swift key.
5343	1356011464616	5	lentwenty ratingfive i thought it was just ok but now i think it's one of the best purchases on my phone.
5344	1356011464616	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it has learned the words i type and the names, even difficult ones.
5345	1356011432562	5	lenten ratingfive when you put it all together, you have a winner.
5346	1356011432562	5	lenfifteen ratingfive perfect key size, fast, fantastic auto-predict and all the options that you would expect.
5347	1356011309939	5	lenthree ratingfive excellent keyboard but.
5348	1356011215144	1	leneight ratingone does not work in dolphin browser on my gs3.
5349	1356011215144	1	lensix ratingone completely unresponsive in an browser window
5350	1356010968884	5	lentwo ratingfive excellent update.
5351	1356010968884	5	lennine ratingfive now need feature to backup learned language from typing.
5352	1356010895751	5	lensixteen ratingfive i've been using this keyboard for over two years and they keep making it better.
5353	1356010895751	5	lentwentyone ratingfive even for major releases, they keep releasing as updates rather than a new app that you would have to pay for.
5354	1356010727779	5	lenfour ratingfive tnx for including tagalog
5355	1356010709229	2	lenfive ratingtwo why still not support chinese?
5356	1356010198611	5	lenfifteen ratingfive it also supports more languages now meaning they have more users who use this keyboard.
5357	1356010054645	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this app
5358	1356009924956	2	lenfour ratingtwo i love this app.
5359	1356009924956	2	leneleven ratingtwo i use it on my samsung galaxy s3 on android 4.1.1 jelly bean.
5360	1356009924956	2	leneleven ratingtwo the only complaints i do have are a couple of bugs.
5361	1356009924956	2	lentwentyeight ratingtwo on occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
5362	1356009924956	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo i am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to facebook.
5363	1356009924956	2	lenten ratingtwo it renders it useless anytime i see something facebook worthy.
5364	1356009924956	2	lentwelve ratingtwo i will give this app five stars when these things are fixed.
5365	1356009845793	5	lensixteen ratingfive well worth the pittance they charge, saves a ridiculous amount of time composing texts and emails.
5366	1356009656895	5	lenfour ratingfive hinglish support is awesome!
5367	1356009621214	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard is still getting better!
5368	1356009621214	5	leneleven ratingfive testing flow now and it is the best of both possibilities!
5369	1356009609542	5	lentwelve ratingfive with the recently added tagalog support, it just became perfect for me!
5370	1356009609542	5	lentwo ratingfive thanks swiftkey!
5371	1356009175854	4	lenfour ratingfour way better than stock!
5372	1356009075090	5	lennine ratingfive i really like this keyboard over the stock version.
5373	1356008947649	5	lensix ratingfive easy, great prediction and incredibly functional.
5374	1356008891697	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i've never used third-party keyboards before but this sounded good enough to try.
5375	1356008891697	5	lenfifteen ratingfive it's actually my first time using the qwerty layout on a mobile device, too.
5376	1356008891697	5	leneight ratingfive swiftkey is making the transition so much easier.
5377	1356008863632	4	leneighteen ratingfour easily the best keyboard on google play, just needs to catch up with asian language support, especially japanese.
5378	1356008557695	5	lensix ratingfive very good keyboard with excellent performance.
5379	1356008557695	5	leneighteen ratingfive just needs to add quick-insert of predefined strings, and a few tweaks such as completion with hyphen.
5380	1356008467551	5	leneighteen ratingfive really speeds up typing on a phone, predictions allow for me to type out things quickly and efficiently.
5381	1356008377751	4	lenthree ratingfour worth the value.
5382	1356008377751	4	leneight ratingfour it will be better if chinese is included.
5383	1356008296577	3	leneleven ratingthree taking up too much memory of late on jb 37mb at times
5384	1356008226875	1	leneight ratingone paid for it twice it's that good.
5385	1356008226875	1	lentwentyfour ratingone would have loved that they gave the tablet version away for free if you already purchased the one for the phone or visa versa.
5386	1356008226875	1	lentwo ratingone changed opinion!
5387	1356008226875	1	lennine ratingone prediction and ai learning how you type stopped working!
5388	1356008115282	5	lensix ratingfive the new update brings new themes.
5389	1356008115282	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive i was pleasantly surprised to find the new berry theme,  which looks awesome with my red bumper case for htc one x. can the devs also make this theme available on the swiftkey flow beta?
5390	1356008115282	5	lentwentythree ratingfive although i haven't been using this keyboard for a while due to the 4.2 keyboard, i shall be using this from now on.
5391	1356008110328	5	lensixteen ratingfive my number one most used app on my phone - so happy i have it ¡è samsung galaxy s2
5392	1356007923210	5	lenfive ratingfive 5 star on my htc desire.
5393	1356007923210	5	leneight ratingfive but keyboard too small on my motorola atrix.
5394	1356007890216	3	leneleven ratingthree good keyboard, great predictions, but loses stars for not having macrons.
5395	1356007890216	3	lenthree ratingthree please implement macrons!
5396	1356007785154	5	lentwo ratingfive perfect keyboard
5397	1356007465886	4	leneleven ratingfour i love this app but how come chinese is still unavailable?
5398	1356007465886	4	lenfour ratingfour when it support chinese!
5399	1356007450963	3	lenfive ratingthree i really like this application.
5400	1356007450963	3	lensix ratingthree but it not have vietnamese language.
5401	1356007450963	3	lensix ratingthree i hope you make it soon.
5402	1356007450963	3	lenfive ratingthree i sorry for my english.
5403	1356007399284	5	leneight ratingfive mai visto niente di meglio in vita mia.
5404	1356007399284	5	lenthree ratingfive soldi meritatissimi, complimenti.
5405	1356007333252	4	lenten ratingfour could u guys please add chinese to the languages list?
5406	1356007333252	4	lenseven ratingfour if u do its a definite 5 star.
5407	1356007333252	4	lenthirteen ratingfour (too bad there is no half stars would've been 4 and a half)
5408	1356007323405	5	lennine ratingfive i exclusively use this for the features and functionality.
5409	1356007323405	5	lenfour ratingfive it is simply excellent.
5410	1356007247577	5	leneleven ratingfive now that i have the note 2 it is kind of frustrating.
5411	1356007247577	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive when i use the multitasking multi windows, the swiftkey keyboard stays the same size when in the samsung keyboard it gets smaller and the keyboard window is able to be moved around.
5412	1356007247577	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i hope swiftkey makes an update soon to be able to do that since i bet there are many note 2 users.
5413	1356007051000	5	lenfive ratingfive best keyboard i've tried!
5414	1356007045792	5	leneighteen ratingfive best keyboard you can get, using it on my galaxy s2 and my friends can't keep up lol.
5415	1356007003267	5	lensix ratingfive and now just waiting for flow.
5416	1356006745713	5	lentwentyone ratingfive at first i found moving from my ios device to android phone quite difficult in particular getting used to the keyboard.
5417	1356006745713	5	lensix ratingfive this app made the transition seamless!
5418	1356006745713	5	lentwo ratingfive absolutely brilliant.
5419	1356006745713	5	lentwentynine ratingfive one fault could be the lack of personal dictionary as it doesn't allow you to save words you use the most etc other than that it's brilliant.
5420	1356006728378	2	leneight ratingtwo would rate this 5  if it  had japanese language.
5421	1356006728378	2	lentwelve ratingtwo i saw the update but disappointed to see no japanese input yet.
5422	1356005489943	3	lenthirteen ratingthree it's a fairly good keyboard but the autocorrection isn't very strong.
5423	1356005489943	3	lennine ratingthree for example, typing pf isn't changed to of.
5424	1356005489943	3	leneight ratingthree i'd say average is a suitable description.
5425	1356004264498	1	lentwentyfive ratingone for some strange reason the swiftkey keyboard keep on skipping keystrokes in random places as i type, making it completely impossible for me to type
5426	1356003185426	4	lensix ratingfour awesome must have, but no emoji.
5427	1356003185426	4	lenten ratingfour and the swedish dictionary is broken, splits composite words up.
5428	1356000184547	5	lenten ratingfive still not loading automatixally at boot even with 4.1.1 os sammy s3
5429	1355998121005	5	lensixteen ratingfive it picked up on the way i talk in my text messages and facebook almost perfectly.
5430	1355998121005	5	leneighteen ratingfive the suggestions for my spelling errors are almost always correct as to what i meant to type too!
5431	1355998121005	5	leneighteen ratingfive i hate how it keeps capitalizing the letter "i" even tho auto capital is off.minor but annoying.
5432	1355997817595	5	lensix ratingfive key has disappeared while using whatsapp.
5433	1355997817595	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive even in gosms, the enter key has shifted to the last row and it's place has been taken by the back arrow key.
5434	1355990628016	5	lenfive ratingfive awesome on my galaxy note
5435	1355984034448	4	lentwo ratingfour great app.
5436	1355984034448	4	lenten ratingfour but i think they should be add a swype setting
5437	1355983378349	3	lenfourteen ratingthree it's great keyboard but i've waiting for thai that you're developing :-)
5438	1355980963216	5	leneight ratingfive easily the best keyboard replacement for android devices.
5439	1355980963216	5	lenseventeen ratingfive it does save me a lot of time and i definitely don't have as many errors.
5440	1355980963216	5	lentwelve ratingfive i also love the ability to swipe back to delete a word.
5441	1355980963216	5	lentwo ratingfive great app!
5442	1355980848885	4	lennineteen ratingfour it's be nice if you could edit smileys or if you had multiple smiley sets to choose from.
5443	1355974003214	4	leneleven ratingfour been using it for months and have nothing bad to say.
5444	1355974003214	4	lenseventeen ratingfour you can type every word in a sentence wrong and it intuitively knows what you're typing.
5445	1355970535106	4	lentwelve ratingfour easy to use, the more you use it the better it gets.
5446	1355970535106	4	lenthirteen ratingfour just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
5447	1355970535106	4	leneight ratingfour reset of phone required to fix issue temporarily.
5448	1355970535106	4	lenthree ratingfour razr m, jb 4.1.1.
5449	1355970535106	4	lenthirteen ratingfour edit: after several reboots and deleting app data, sk3 seems to be stable again.
5450	1355970535106	4	lennineteen ratingfour frustrating since i had to delete all of the learned suggestions, but it's back so i'm happy.
5451	1355970207800	5	lenseven ratingfive the best app for my galaxy siii
5452	1355969809662	5	lensix ratingfive this is the best touch keyboard.
5453	1355969809662	5	lenthree ratingfive predictive is awesome.
5454	1355969809662	5	lennine ratingfive heat map is ridiculously efficient after a few weeks.
5455	1355966426037	4	leneight ratingfour great app but wish there were more themes
5456	1355966373522	5	leneight ratingfive sure would like to see some new themes
5457	1355966305408	3	leneight ratingthree keeps switching back to the dafult samsung keyboard.
5458	1355966280997	3	leneight ratingthree i thought it'd be a little better.
5459	1355966280997	3	lenfour ratingthree especially for the price
5460	1355959756708	5	lentwentythree ratingfive the trouble i've always had with android phones is that the key boards are inaccurate and never choose the correct spelling correction.
5461	1355959756708	5	lensix ratingfive this app completely fixed that issue.
5462	1355959756708	5	lenseventeen ratingfive the keyboard in general is more accurate and it picks the correct correction most of the time.
5463	1355959351388	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i've tried quite a few different keyboards, and this is the best.
5464	1355959351388	5	lenten ratingfive it reads my mind and corrects all my typos flawlessly.
5465	1355959351388	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny.
5466	1355958735662	5	lennine ratingfive best keyboard ever, been using it since the betas!
5467	1355958735662	5	lentwelve ratingfive xd  would be nice if the flow function was implemented into it.
5468	1355955540965	4	lennineteen ratingfour when i updated to jb, after every restart the keyboard swaps from swiftkey as my default to standard keyboard.
5469	1355955540965	4	leneleven ratingfour and it seems to be tad laggy at time when typing.
5470	1355955540965	4	lenseven ratingfour kinda similar to my galaxy s2 on ics.
5471	1355955540965	4	leneleven ratingfour if you can address those issues, i'll bump to 5 stars
5472	1355954722288	4	lenseven ratingfour i absolutely suck at touch screen texting!
5473	1355954722288	4	lentwelve ratingfour i hated the stock keyboard for samaung so i tried this trail.
5474	1355954722288	4	lenseven ratingfour loved it and bought the full version.
5475	1355954722288	4	lensix ratingfour although it does multiply some letters.
5476	1355954722288	4	lennine ratingfour mostly g, but also sometimes it deletes words randomly.
5477	1355954722288	4	leneight ratingfour please fix then this app will be perfect!
5478	1355954544505	4	lensix ratingfour i finally figured out my issue.
5479	1355954544505	4	lensixteen ratingfour now my only gripe is that using a lot of the learning features drains the battery.
5480	1355950964963	4	lentwentytwo ratingfour would be great to have a few more skins and not have the space bar soo tiny when inputting urls or searches.
5481	1355950964963	4	lenthirtytwo ratingfour otherwise very fast and love the reliability, would suggest adding a no filter option, i'm sure a majority of us are adults and wouldn't mind letting out a swear word.
5482	1355950293764	5	lensixteen ratingfive keyboard app is the most important app on your phone, and this one is the best.
5483	1355941693892	4	lenten ratingfour still needs work to fix bugs and add features, etc
5484	1355941007916	3	lentwentyfour ratingthree great app but since jellybean everytime my battery dies or i restart my phone i need to set this up as an input again.
5485	1355941007916	3	lennine ratingthree shame really because it's great other than this.
5486	1355937660461	4	lentwentynine ratingfour i love this keyboard and find it an excellent addition to my phone extensions however i would like to buy just one app for tablet and phone, not both.
5487	1355937660461	4	lenten ratingfour other than that a great alternative to a standard keyboard!
5488	1355935903067	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive does make typeing much easier onky thing is i would like to have a few more key board skins such as a neon green version of the pumpkin.
5489	1355933105913	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i think that this application would be perfect if it has swipe functionality.
5490	1355931311502	4	lenfifteen ratingfour it is very disturbing when you restart/turn off the phone, swiftkey 3 loses its defaults.
5491	1355931311502	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i have to go manually and changed it after each restart on galaxy s3.
5492	1355931311502	4	lenseven ratingfour too much pushing for a paid app.
5493	1355929304095	4	lentwelve ratingfour one little thing annoys me tho: the auto correct is really stubborn!
5494	1355929304095	4	lentwentynine ratingfour unlike the ics keyboard, backspacing does not get rid of the auto corrected word,  so i'm forced to delete it manually and select it from the suggestion bar.
5495	1355929304095	4	lenten ratingfour until this feature is added,  my rating will stay at 4 ¡ï¡ï¡ï¡ï.
5496	1355929304095	4	lenfifteen ratingfour it would also be nice to have more themes or support for third party themes.
5497	1355929304095	4	lenthree ratingfour overall, great keyboard.
5498	1355914243236	4	lensix ratingfour really speed of up the typing.
5499	1355914243236	4	lenten ratingfour only one complaint:why no chinese in the language list?
5500	1355904754303	3	lenthree ratingthree waiting thai language.
5501	1355903941121	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive great keyboard, very fast very silk  i can wait for the next update (flow)  im using the beta version of it and it amazing.
5502	1355903941121	5	lennine ratingfive i wish you could sort the voice input problem.
5503	1355903941121	5	lenseven ratingfive for any language it would use english
5504	1355902505037	5	lenfour ratingfive very easy and quick
5505	1355900895961	1	leneleven ratingone definitely not made for the samsung note 2 and the s pen.
5506	1355900895961	1	leneighteen ratingone if you have the phone, simply walk away for this program as it is not made for it.
5507	1355900005019	5	lenfive ratingfive amazing app best keyboard ever
5508	1355897701063	5	leneleven ratingfive this needs more themes and options to personalize the key bored
5509	1355895952492	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo it's great at gathering data to predict but words randomly disappear or insert themselves.
5510	1355895952492	2	lentwentysix ratingtwo also two really annoying things are that when you put the cursor in a word to correct it, it inserts that word instead of replacing it.
5511	1355895952492	2	lenthirtythree ratingtwo then when it autocorrects for you and you backspace, it doesn't put your word back nor does it learn from the fact that you've backspaced and typed your word several times.
5512	1355895952492	2	leneighteen ratingtwo i don't like the slide punctuation key and the dot com/spacebar combo gets in the way.
5513	1355892352516	3	lenthirtythree ratingthree i just wish they would come out with a lot more themes or give option to install custom made themes by other people please make new themes or ler us customize our own
5514	1355890316933	5	lentwo ratingfive amazing keyboard.
5515	1355890316933	5	lenthree ratingfive no horrible bugs.
5516	1355890316933	5	lentwo ratingfive great features.
5517	1355890316933	5	lenten ratingfive the intelligent typing is perfect if you're all thumbs!
5518	1355889036765	5	lenfive ratingfive this keyboard is absolutely fantastic!
5519	1355889036765	5	lentwelve ratingfive it is the best money i have spent on the app market.
5520	1355889036765	5	leneleven ratingfive this is a must have for anyone with a smart phone
5521	1355882788117	5	lenfour ratingfive best keyboard prediction period
5522	1355872522537	5	lenfour ratingfive really enjoy this keyboard.
5523	1355872522537	5	leneleven ratingfive as i'm a rapid tester it predicts things pretty good!
5524	1355872522537	5	lenten ratingfive i think it could do with a bit more customization.
5525	1355872522537	5	lentwenty ratingfive and a few more settings for example, after i insert specific types of punctuation it sometimes put a space after.
5526	1355872522537	5	lentwentysix ratingfive also another good one is being able to make the space bar bigger by removing the smiley key on the bottom right making the keyboard bigger.
5527	1355872522537	5	leneight ratingfive but over all,  it's a great app!
5528	1355868865446	5	lentwelve ratingfive i had this app for one year and i still love it.
5529	1350826190106	5	leneleven ratingfive i really didn't expect this app to be this good.
5530	1350826190106	5	lensixteen ratingfive i'm constantly correctly mistakes on the native android keyboard but this one is spot on.
5531	1350826190106	5	lenfifteen ratingfive for the first time it feels like i can actually touch type on my phone.
5532	1350826190106	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive there's also small key differences that make the difference such as being able to put question marks and exclamation marks without having to scroll through keyboards.
5533	1350826190106	5	lenfourteen ratingfive it's that good that it should be standard on all android os releases.
5534	1350826190106	5	lenfour ratingfive well worth the money!
5535	1350826125136	2	lentwentyfive ratingtwo swiftkey plus chrome plus certain types of forms (particularly ones that require an email address) leads to a very ugly slow motion crash on ics.
5536	1350825822924	5	lensix ratingfive every android phone should have this!
5537	1350825822924	5	lentwenty ratingfive one request, as others have said, would be to be able to change the number pad to a pc layout.
5538	1350825822924	5	lennine ratingfive it's just backwards the way it currently is.
5539	1350825499001	3	lentwelve ratingthree best keyboard i've tried so far - which wasn't many tbh.
5540	1350825499001	3	leneleven ratingthree still quite buggy, lags terribly and slows down phone at times.
5541	1350825499001	3	lenthree ratingthree galaxy s gingerbread 2.3.4
5542	1350824199925	5	lensix ratingfive far better than the native keyboard.
5543	1350823684560	1	lenthree ratingone thai language please
5544	1350815590904	5	lenseven ratingfive need to fix arabic on jelly bean
5545	1350815544157	5	lenthirteen ratingfive if you try this one you will never want to try another one!
5546	1350808337314	5	lenfive ratingfive i love it! -evo v
5547	1350807081622	4	lenten ratingfour i have this both on my tablet and my phone.
5548	1350807081622	4	lensixteen ratingfour it's truly magic in how well it makes predictions and gets it right every time.
5549	1350807081622	4	lensix ratingfour it absolutely rocks on the tablet.
5550	1350807081622	4	lentwelve ratingfour on the phone i still find its a bit small to use.
5551	1350807081622	4	lenfifteen ratingfour if phone keypad was included as a layout, it would combine speed with advanced prediction.
5552	1350801470669	3	lenfifteen ratingthree please put this letters on a long press for croatian input, keys are toooooo small.
5553	1350801100984	4	lenseven ratingfour recently experiencing freezing at times in landscape.
5554	1350800967057	5	lenthirteen ratingfive if you're a galaxy s3 user, shut up and give them your money.
5555	1350800967057	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive swiftkey took one of the biggest negative things about my phone's overall usability and made it one of its best features.
5556	1350800967057	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive obviously, you like anecdotal evidence if you're reading reviews, so here are the results of a typing test i just did comparing the native samsung keyboard to ios and swiftkey.
5557	1350800967057	5	lenfourteen ratingfive test was performed using a 500 character paragraph made up of 95% words and 5% numeric characters.
5558	1350800967057	5	lennineteen ratingfive keep in mind i've been an ios user for 3 years, so naturally, i'm more comfortable using it.
5559	1350800967057	5	leneight ratingfive i had been using swiftkey for about 10 minutes.
5560	1350800967057	5	lenthirteen ratingfive swiftkey setting was "rapid typer", "space autofills current word", and "double space period."
5561	1350800967057	5	lenfifteen ratingfive iphone -      45wpm -   4 typos samsung -  20 wpm - 10 typos swiftkey -   40 wpm -   0 typos  and interestingly:  speech to text - 158 wpm - 2 typos
5562	1350799110683	4	lentwentysix ratingfour it helps to message really well,  but when it comes to filling up forms online (feedback, etc), the corrected words get inserted all over the place!
5563	1350796035568	5	lensix ratingfive it's well worth your money.
5564	1350794698619	2	lenseven ratingtwo complete trash compared to the perfect keyboard.
5565	1350794698619	2	lennine ratingtwo the perfect keyboard is incredibly more precise and customizable.
5566	1350792233406	4	lennine ratingfour i love this app and especially the predictive typing.
5567	1350792233406	4	leneleven ratingfour (1) somes crashes when cutting/copying text, although it restarts itself in 20sec.
5568	1350792233406	4	lenfifteen ratingfour (2) would like a way to shift-lock the number &  symbol keys of the main keyboard.
5569	1350792233406	4	lensixteen ratingfour (3) sometimes locks up so that scrolling through text is lost when exceeds bottom of typing area.
5570	1350792233406	4	leneight ratingfour in fact this happened while typing this review.
5571	1350789850275	5	lenfive ratingfive i really love this app.
5572	1350789850275	5	leneleven ratingfive i like it a lot better than the stock samsung keyboard.
5573	1350789850275	5	lenfour ratingfive the prediction is wonderful.
5574	1350789850275	5	lennine ratingfive it learns by how you type and remembers it.
5575	1350789850275	5	lenthree ratingfive samsung galaxy siii
5576	1350784145328	4	lenfive ratingfour it really needs more themes.
5577	1350784145328	4	lenseventeen ratingfour a nice black and red one in particular, similar to the neon but red instead of blue.
5578	1350784145328	4	lenfive ratingfour five stars for more themes.
5579	1350778924775	5	lenfour ratingfive i love my keyboard!
5580	1350778924775	5	lensix ratingfive i will never regret buying this.
5581	1350776073329	5	lentwentythree ratingfive better than the jelly bean keyboard i can customise the colour which i love, the more it knows me the better it is
5582	1350775334908	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i was nervous about installing this on my galaxy nexus as i thought it might be a backstep from the stock keypad.
5583	1350775011504	4	lenfive ratingfour i really like this app.
5584	1350775011504	4	lensix ratingfour wish more themes were available tho.
5585	1350772523761	4	lensix ratingfour good app for my note 2 biatch   ,.
5586	1350772176911	5	lennine ratingfive when switching from a hard keyboard to on screen.
5587	1350772176911	5	lensix ratingfive auto correct can be a nightmare.
5588	1350772176911	5	lenthree ratingfive this ap helps.
5589	1350772176911	5	lenthree ratingfive wort the buy
5590	1350771519663	4	leneleven ratingfour best keyboard o have ever used auto corrects like a boss
5591	1350770531891	5	lenfive ratingfive great work for language input.
5592	1350770531891	5	lensix ratingfive well designed and easy to use
5593	1350770479934	2	lenfive ratingtwo this app is quite impressive.
5594	1350770479934	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo please add a setting to remove word suggestions when using my hard keyboard.
5595	1350770479934	2	leneight ratingtwo with that, this would be a 5 star app.
5596	1350767633734	5	lenten ratingfive try the free version and see if you like it.
5597	1350764531670	5	leneleven ratingfive i want it to be able to learn from whatsapp too!
5598	1350761334932	5	lennine ratingfive just awesome.the best app in the play store
5599	1350759272301	1	lentwentyeight ratingone every time i'm typing a long status on face book this keyboard will take words i'm typing and put them in the beginning of the status.
5600	1350758748021	1	leneight ratingone free trial was awesome but not the paid.
5601	1350758748021	1	lenfour ratingone keyboard shuts out randomly.
5602	1350758748021	1	lenfive ratingone uses excessive amounts of ram.
5603	1350758748021	1	lenfourteen ratingone and a few bugs not worth mentiining cause i could have over looked those.
5604	1350758748021	1	leneighteen ratingone but the worst part is i just paid for this about 30 minutes ago and it starts having issues.
5605	1350758748021	1	leneight ratingone so i uninstall and goto get a refund.
5606	1350758748021	1	lenten ratingone well the option is not there anymore for a refund.
5607	1350758748021	1	lenfour ratingone i want my refund.
5608	1350755379010	5	lenfive ratingfive best app downloaded so far.
5609	1350755379010	5	leneight ratingfive the predictions saved me a lot of time.
5610	1350752434030	5	leneleven ratingfive this is the best app on the market place hands down.
5611	1350752434030	5	lenseventeen ratingfive it's amazing how accurate the auto correct is and how it adapts to your typing style.
5612	1350752434030	5	leneleven ratingfive it really is sophisticated and deserves all the recognition it gets.
5613	1350752434030	5	leneighteen ratingfive removing saved words from the library is an extremely helpful feature that is probably over looked as well.
5614	1350752434030	5	lentwelve ratingfive if you buy this app i guarantee you will not regret it.
5615	1350752252979	4	lensixteen ratingfour it seems to conflict with the carrier (kddi au) email app in regards to auto-capitalisation.
5616	1350752252979	4	leneleven ratingfour if switched on the first letter of every word is capitialised.
5617	1350752252979	4	lenten ratingfour if switched off then first letter is always lower case.
5618	1350752252979	4	lensix ratingfour other keyboards work fine with it.
5619	1350752252979	4	lentwentythree ratingfour small thing but it makes my typing a lot slower as i don't like every word as if starting a new sentence!
5620	1350751933419	5	lennineteen ratingfive only thing left for it to do is literally read my mind and translate it into text for me.
5621	1350751933419	5	lenthree ratingfive really great app
5622	1350749697208	5	lenfive ratingfive so much easier to type.
5623	1350749176991	5	lenfour ratingfive absolutely love this app
5624	1350747042102	5	leneight ratingfive this should be a mandatory purchase for all.
5625	1350747042102	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i really can't believe i've lived for years without thus keyboard app.
5626	1350747042102	5	lenfive ratingfive outstanding intelligence for predictive texting.
5627	1350745734289	5	lenseven ratingfive the left swipe erase makes it great.
5628	1350742235007	4	lenseven ratingfour good but haptic is a bit funky!
5629	1350741268970	4	lensix ratingfour only for swiftkey to break it.
5630	1350741268970	4	lentwentyone ratingfour since it is really the one thing that sets them apart from the rest of the other keyboard apps out there.
5631	1350737198674	2	lenfour ratingtwo wanted refund as useless .
5632	1350736231066	3	lennine ratingthree no auto correction or spelling prediction in polaris office.
5633	1350732575846	5	lenfifteen ratingfive wow, it really is very fast and reduces the typing time to an unbelievable extent.
5634	1350732322702	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive best keyboard i have used, defiantly makes it where i don't miss my i phone keyboard this is a must have
5635	1350726716008	5	leneleven ratingfive swift key makes writing messages and emails so simple and quick.
5636	1350726716008	5	lenfifteen ratingfive it remembers things you write so can predict what you're going to type next.
5637	1350723525368	5	lenseven ratingfive must have app for all android users.
5638	1350721483668	3	lentwo ratingthree chæ°a cã³ g? tiáº¿ng viá»t nam.
5639	1350719911137	4	lensix ratingfour please add emojis and other stuff
5640	1350708598389	5	leneight ratingfive keyboard predictions are much better than stock android.
5641	1350708598389	5	lentwo ratingfive rivals iphone
5642	1350707161555	5	leneighteen ratingfive swiftkey is probably going to be the first and only app i will ever buy for my phone.
5643	1350707161555	5	lenthirtyseven ratingfive it quickly adapted to my typing style (i tend to hit the n key instead of the space bar a lot) and i swear that sometimes it even knows what i want to say before i do.
5644	1350707161555	5	lenseven ratingfive i have not had to actually "teach"
5645	1350705335891	5	lentwo ratingfive nice keyboard
5646	1350703429207	5	lenfive ratingfive best app ever hands down!
5647	1350702046271	4	lenfive ratingfour best keyboard on the market!
5648	1350702046271	4	lenthirtytwo ratingfour please, developer team, never stop support! :d took off a star because if you long press on a key, then move to other keys it will never choose the long press option.
5649	1350702046271	4	lensixteen ratingfour basically, you don't have to release the long press to get the long press option.
5650	1350701906073	1	lentwo ratingone great keyboard.
5651	1350701906073	1	lenfourteen ratingone if only it didn't become disabled every time i plug my phone in.
5652	1350701906073	1	lenfour ratingone makes it completely useless.
5653	1350701318221	4	lentwelve ratingfour my lg lucid upgraded to ics today and swiftkey has been slow!
5654	1350700752249	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive i tend to hit the letter "b" instead of the space bar sometimes and it fails to predict that i'm trying to hit the space bar.
5655	1350700752249	5	lenfive ratingfive no complaints aside from that.
5656	1350699480203	5	lensix ratingfive excellent app for text, and email
5657	1350699185594	5	leneight ratingfive really prefer this keyboard over any samsung keyboard.
5658	1350699185594	5	lennine ratingfive ended up shelling out for it when trial expired.
5659	1350697995556	5	lensix ratingfive could not live without this keyboard.
5660	1350697995556	5	lenten ratingfive the set up, feel, look and overall flow is incredible.
5661	1350697995556	5	leneleven ratingfive learns how i type and what i would most likely say.
5662	1350697995556	5	lentwo ratingfive definitely recommended.
5663	1350697995556	5	lensix ratingfive every update gets better and better.
5664	1350693596061	5	lensixteen ratingfive so much easier for me to see,  easier to use for my hand size and dexterity.
5665	1350687848084	4	lensixteen ratingfour i am so used to this new keyboard that i don't want to go back.
5666	1350687848084	4	lenseventeen ratingfour after a month using it, the keyboard types all over the place, also sending texts before completed.
5667	1350687848084	4	lentwo ratingfour razr maxx
5668	1350684570163	4	lenfifteen ratingfour one would think it would work well with google products but is far from it.
5669	1350684570163	4	lentwenty ratingfour i use google chrome a lot and it crashes a lot as well and it's because of the keyboard.
5670	1350684570163	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour the keyboard is quite customizable and has a lot of options that makes it a product you can't miss on your android device.
5671	1350682659799	5	lensix ratingfive really fantastic, totally  worth the money!
5672	1350681320401	2	leneighteen ratingtwo it's alright i guess but it seems to have a knack for freezing up high end devices
5673	1350679349198	3	lenfive ratingthree when is more themes coming
5674	1350676330408	4	lenseventeen ratingfour is there a way to improve the speed of closing the keyboard when i exit an app.
5675	1350676330408	4	lenseventeen ratingfour also any way to make the keyboard scroll down while trying to view text in horizontal mode?
5676	1350676330408	4	lentwelve ratingfour would make reading texts easier without dragging down to close the keyboard.
5677	1350676330408	4	lentwo ratingfour otherwise, excellent!
5678	1350674175570	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i've tried many downloaded  keyboards and this one is by far the best.
5679	1350674175570	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome app.!
5680	1350673527590	1	lenfifteen ratingone keyboard was great but the killed the prediction accuracy with tweaks in the latest update.
5681	1350673527590	1	lenfour ratingone please restore for 5 stars
5682	1350672972851	4	lentwo ratingfour amazing keyboard.
5683	1350672972851	4	lenfive ratingfour saves a lot of time.
5684	1350672972851	4	lenten ratingfour one thing i would love to have would be shortcuts.
5685	1350672972851	4	lenseven ratingfour add that and you have a 5 star!
5686	1350671583453	4	lentwenty ratingfour absolutely love this keyboard, my only wishing is it would be cool if there was a dedicated row for numbers.
5687	1350671252970	5	lenseven ratingfive i am so glad i bought this.
5688	1350671252970	5	lenten ratingfive this keyboard is much better than the standard android keyboard.
5689	1350670911381	5	lenfortyseven ratingfive best kb app available, i doubt most other themes are very popular(?) so should be removed, cobalt is my fav, dark would be better if the green was changed to match ics blue theme similar to cobalt, but that's just my opinion so well deserved 5 stars!
5690	1350670005300	5	lenfive ratingfive running this on gb 2.36, cm9,  and cm10.
5691	1350670005300	5	lentwenty ratingfive i've used so many keyboards including swype beta but this app beats them all in overall speed and accuracy.
5692	1350670005300	5	lenthirteen ratingfive while i do like swiping, but it's only fast for small words.
5693	1350670005300	5	lennineteen ratingfive so when i tried swiftkey i was surprised how it almost types itself,  thus,  saving a lot of time.
5694	1350670005300	5	lenfourteen ratingfive been using this for over a month - typing on touchscreen is actually enjoyable now.
5695	1350669589794	5	lennine ratingfive why didn't i find this app months ago?
5696	1350669589794	5	lenseven ratingfive way better than the crappy android ones.
5697	1350669589794	5	leneight ratingfive if you added mandarin,  it would be perfect.
5698	1350669239355	5	leneleven ratingfive needs to use more of user words like in go keyboard!
5699	1350669239355	5	lenfive ratingfive more themes would be better
5700	1350667680465	4	leneleven ratingfour only gripe is that it crashed on a couple of occasions.
5701	1350667680465	4	lenfive ratingfour i guess theupdate fixed it.
5702	1350666564286	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo this crashes at minimum ten times a day during web browsing via chrome.
5703	1350664727124	3	lenseven ratingthree predictions are not working in any browser.
5704	1350664727124	3	lenfour ratingthree makes this keyboard useless.
5705	1350664473403	5	lenfour ratingfive app is completely unusable.
5706	1350664473403	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive keyboard will not show when i need to type so i uninstalled and reinstalled and now i cannot download the language pack so it won't let me past the welcome screen.
5707	1350664473403	5	leneight ratingfive when the app does work it's amazing.
5708	1350664473403	5	lenfive ratingfive hard to live without it!
5709	1350664365814	3	lenthree ratingthree lags while typing.
5710	1350664365814	3	lensix ratingthree its annoying when it becomes slow
5711	1350663534177	2	lentwelve ratingtwo i have a samsung galaxy s2 that was constantly crashing, amongst other problems.
5712	1350663534177	2	lenfifteen ratingtwo it went off for a repair and came back perfect until i installed swiftkey 3 again.
5713	1350663534177	2	lennine ratingtwo i emailed the devs but never got a response.
5714	1350663534177	2	lentwelve ratingtwo i love the keyboard but not all the problems it has caused!
5715	1350663534177	2	lennine ratingtwo very disappointed that i wasted my money on this!
5716	1350663157207	1	lensixteen ratingone com button when typing in a browser url is the most annoying thing about this keyboard.
5717	1350663157207	1	leneight ratingone i bought this keyboard for my fat fingers.
5718	1350663157207	1	lennine ratingone it does the job but has some weird quirks.
5719	1350663157207	1	lentwentyfive ratingone forget trying to just type and send. u have to triple check all the word predictions and stupid commas when double hitting the space bar.
5720	1350663157207	1	lenfive ratingone stick with the stock keyboard.
5721	1350662239093	3	lentwentynine ratingthree over rated.over rated.yeah u get the picture, im not sayin its bad, its just not great, and i paid a dime for it over a year ago.
5722	1350662239093	3	lenthirtyfour ratingthree i hae like 6diff $ kb on play, thumb kb gets my vote, but i still prefer my ics blue themed swype on my s2 or syncing my sk to it if i gotta right a paper.
5723	1350662239093	3	lentwelve ratingthree personally i think i liked the old version of this apk better
5724	1350661619661	2	lensixteen ratingtwo works well but every time i restart my phone i have to change the keyboard settings.
5725	1350661619661	2	lenfour ratingtwo nexus one on gingerbread
5726	1350659710405	5	lenfive ratingfive great keyboard.all others suck.
5727	1350658438507	5	lenfour ratingfive a must buy app.
5728	1350658438507	5	leneleven ratingfive it's got awesome prediction capabilities and really great keyboard interface.
5729	1350658438507	5	lenthirteen ratingfive but sometimes i feel it still isn't blending with the os perfectly.
5730	1350658438507	5	lenfive ratingfive probably its gingerbread's fault
5731	1350658109497	4	lenten ratingfour the only thing needed is swype to make it complete :)
5732	1350656490540	1	lennineteen ratingone i love the keyboard but when i type texting 6 times and it shows tearing i get a bit frustrated.
5733	1350656490540	1	leneleven ratingone or when i type an actual word and it corrects it.
5734	1350656490540	1	lensix ratingone especially when that word is correct.
5735	1350656490540	1	lenfive ratingone i'm a fast typer.
5736	1350656490540	1	lenfifteen ratingone i don't rely on auto correct often, but when i do, it's off.
5737	1350656490540	1	lennine ratingone it needs more customization, updates, and a user dictionary.
5738	1350656490540	1	lentwentyone ratingone you're making it seem you dun care about your customers. -.- updates are almost always minor and maybe once every 2-3 months.
5739	1350654794643	5	lenten ratingfive pops up words and phrases i use all the time.
5740	1350654794643	5	lentwo ratingfive great app!
5741	1350654138275	5	lenfive ratingfive but this keyboard is awesome!
5742	1350653912501	5	lenfour ratingfive * os 4.1.2 fixes the bug.
5743	1350653912501	5	lenten ratingfive original issue - gets removed as default keyboard after every reboot.
5744	1350652817903	3	lensix ratingthree great but smart keyboard is better!
5745	1350651812361	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo i enjoyed using this keyboard for a couple years on my htc inspire 4g.
5746	1350651812361	2	lenthirtyeight ratingtwo however, on my new htc one x (which has a considerably larger and more high resolution screen), i find the small size of swiftkey to be virtually unusable for me, so i have reverted to the stock keyboard.
5747	1350651812361	2	lentwentyseven ratingtwo too bad, because i did enjoy the features of swiftkey, but i make so many errors using swiftkey on the hox that i can't use it.
5748	1350650761968	5	lenfour ratingfive better than i hoped.
5749	1350650761968	5	lentwentysix ratingfive the samsung stock keyboard on my galaxy siii is so lame in comparison, it makes me think samsung is getting a kickback from swiftkey and google;)
5750	1350647285294	5	lentwelve ratingfive much better than the stock keyboards on my current and past devices.
5751	1350647285294	5	leneleven ratingfive i use it every day and really love the predictive text.
5752	1350646231226	5	leneleven ratingfive this app is really amazing how it can improve your typing.
5753	1350646231226	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i if you do not have this app and your worried about the price, don't be because it is 100% worth it.
5754	1350646231226	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i it is also a bonus that you can customize the keyboard in awesomeness!
5755	1350645390844	5	leneighteen ratingfive well i have found my new keyboard i have tried many and this seems to be the best.!
5756	1350645390844	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive i have pretty thick thumbs and i have typos all the time but this keyboard makes it possible to type what i want without any of the hassle
5757	1350644591879	5	lenthree ratingfive best keyboard app.
5758	1350644591879	5	lennine ratingfive highly recommended as the default android keyboard on s3 sucks.
5759	1350644591879	5	lennine ratingfive worth the payment as well as recommended to friends.
5760	1350642693401	5	lenfive ratingfive the word predictions are superb.
5761	1350642693401	5	leneight ratingfive saves a lot of time in the process.
5762	1350642693401	5	lensix ratingfive a must for every android user!
5763	1350642592496	4	lenthirtytwo ratingfour been waiting for a fix to the default keyboard being selected after reboot (instead of swiftkey)  and just updated jellybean on my phone to 4.2.1 and it now seems like everything is okay.
5764	1350642592496	4	lensix ratingfour this is my favorite keyboard again.
5765	1350642315807	5	lentwelve ratingfive but in romanian predictions are not even close to those in english.
5766	1350642315807	5	lennine ratingfive it would be great an update of romanian dictionary.
5767	1350642315807	5	lenten ratingfive and it would be good to learn email addresses too.
5768	1350641580959	4	lenseven ratingfour if only they would add handwriting recognition.
5769	1350639618162	2	lensixteen ratingtwo after the last update and the (smart space) i lost all my respect to this keyboard.
5770	1350639618162	2	lenfive ratingtwo especially for the arabic language.
5771	1350639618162	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo i fell it's not learning -like before- from my way of typing!
5772	1350639618162	2	lennine ratingtwo this keyboard was my best keyboard in the market.
5773	1350633249338	5	lenfive ratingfive this keyboard is a necessity.
5774	1350624889172	4	lennineteen ratingfour best keyboard replacement i have ever used but it keeps popping up with select keyboard in the notification bar
5775	1350622979247	4	lennineteen ratingfour please give us the option to remove the smiley button and replace it with a return key  thank you!
5776	1350622020384	4	lensix ratingfour okay this is a great app.
5777	1350622020384	4	lenten ratingfour it almost seems as if it's reading your mind.
5778	1350622020384	4	leneight ratingfour talk about saving a lot of valuable time.
5779	1350622020384	4	lenten ratingfour i don't know how i survived without this app.
5780	1350620219428	5	lennine ratingfive definitely made typing a hell of a lot easier!
5781	1350619917514	3	lentwo ratingthree pretty awesome!
5782	1350619917514	3	lensixteen ratingthree it would be better if it could be used on google search and on my browser.
5783	1350619917514	3	leneleven ratingthree and now it doesnt want to download the english or spanish
5784	1350619516540	3	lentwentynine ratingthree it would be nice if the keyboard would have better smiley faces or imoticons the ones it has now are so boring  then i would absolutely rate it a 5.
5785	1350618597065	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i've used this app for a month, and it has finally made typing on a touchscreen a viable input option!
5786	1350618597065	5	lentwentythree ratingfive basically, you don't have to look at your fingers as you type because the auto correct this app contains is so effective.
5787	1350618597065	5	lenthree ratingfive definitely a buy.
5788	1350616196475	1	lenthree ratingone restarts my phone.
5789	1350616196475	1	lenthree ratingone a real bummer.
5790	1350616196475	1	lenthree ratingone love this keyboard
5791	1350613302341	4	lenfour ratingfour so worth the money!
5792	1350613302341	4	leneight ratingfour i just wish it worked on my facebook.
5793	1350613302341	4	leneight ratingfour instead it only is active when i text.
5794	1350612256771	4	lenthree ratingfour very nice keyboard.
5795	1350612256771	4	lenfive ratingfour try the free trial out!
5796	1350612256771	4	lentwentyone ratingfour would like to change a setting so that when i press the full stop, it doesn't automatically add a space.
5797	1350610359125	5	leneleven ratingfive i'm not sure i prefer tap keyboards or swype keyboards.
5798	1350610359125	5	lenfour ratingfive i try using both.
5799	1350610359125	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive this one is the best tap style, and it lets you use google's voice dictation software which is better than dragon, which swype forces you to use.
5800	1350606008685	4	leneighteen ratingfour i have been using swiftkey for the past 1 year on the s2 and note 1 and no problems at all.
5801	1350606008685	4	lentwentyone ratingfour on my new note 2, i noticed that the keyboard occasionally becomes unresponsive especially the letters o and l. please fix this.
5802	1350598967077	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard.
5803	1350598967077	5	lentwelve ratingfive the predictive text is amazingly accurate when compared with default samsung s3 keyboard.
5804	1350598967077	5	lenseven ratingfive great features that further improve typing efficiency.
5805	1350598967077	5	lenfifteen ratingfive excellent investment, and i've got so much use out of this app, total bargain!
5806	1350594518959	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome keyboard.
5807	1350594518959	5	lenfour ratingfive definitely worth the money.
5808	1350594518959	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive at first a lot of people might think that the predictive texting sucks for it because it has to learn how you type first.
5809	1350594518959	5	lenfourteen ratingfive once you've typed on it for a little while it is simply amazing.
5810	1350594518959	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive you might also have to change a few small settings to taylor it how you want it to auto space, period, and what not.
5811	1350594518959	5	lennine ratingfive it can even learn from facebook, gmail, and twitter.
5812	1350593945196	5	lennine ratingfive this is the ultimate keyboard i was looking for!
5813	1350591933152	3	lentwentythree ratingthree changed from 5 to 3 starts until the issue where the predictions don't show up after i turn my screen off then on again.
5814	1350591769427	3	lenfour ratingthree please allow whatsapp personalization!
5815	1350588404601	3	leneight ratingthree can you please fix the lag with ics?
5816	1350588404601	3	leneighteen ratingthree it was so smooth on gingerbread and i don't know what happened because no other keyboard lags.
5817	1350588404601	3	lensixteen ratingthree i've tried everything out there and nothing comes close in prediction and ease of use.
5818	1350588404601	3	lenfourteen ratingthree but because the other ones don't lag i'm using something else now.
5819	1350588404601	3	lentwentyeight ratingthree i thought it was an ics problem but no other keyboard is lagging like this.i want to be back on swiftkey, please roll out a fix.please.
5820	1350587421419	3	leneight ratingthree was my standard now too laggy on my gs3.
5821	1350583478649	5	lenthree ratingfive worth every penny!
5822	1350581650772	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i freaking love this keyboard, it makes typing easy and fun and useful.
5823	1350581650772	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommended!
5824	1350579225129	5	lenfive ratingfive my fave keyboard so far.
5825	1350579225129	5	lenfour ratingfive predictive texting is awesome!
5826	1350579225129	5	leneleven ratingfive i've even used swype and this is still my favorite. :)
5827	1350578518855	5	leneleven ratingfive i was sceptic and this is crazy,  but swiftkey is awesome
5828	1350577054721	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard.
5829	1350577054721	5	lensixteen ratingfive it's perfect for english, however i am looking forward to more improvements of other languages.
5830	1350577054721	5	lenthree ratingfive (also using russian)
5831	1350576276485	5	lenfour ratingfive superior keyboard very intuitive
5832	1350575982770	5	leneleven ratingfive works great on the s3!and is way better then stock keyboard.
5833	1350575982770	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommend!

5840	1350559948402	5	lentwo ratingfive amazing keyboard.
5841	1350559948402	5	lenfifteen ratingfive no problems love how it learns your words and predicts the next word to use.
5842	1350559948402	5	lenten ratingfive fast and simple for both the fast and accurate typers!
5843	1350559173853	5	lenfive ratingfive looks awesome and works great!
5844	1350559173853	5	lentwo ratingfive thanks swiftkey!
5845	1350559173853	5	lenthirteen ratingfive my daily keyboard from now since it now supports my language (korean) :d
5846	1350554878349	1	lenseven ratingone it does not even include chinese language.
5847	1350548075290	5	lenfive ratingfive an excellent application for typing.

5852	1350534129067	5	leneighteen ratingfive and makes typing on a touch screen easier coming from someone who was used to a physical keyboard.
5853	1350530680632	4	lenseven ratingfour this made me hate my stock keyboard.
5854	1350527069743	5	lenseventeen ratingfive encantado con este teclado, vale la pena lo que gaste en serio que si no me arrepiento.

5858	1350524825670	5	lentwelve ratingfive but i wish you could tell it to default to one language.
5859	1350524825670	5	lenfifteen ratingfive other than that, it's awesome to type half an email without doing any letters.
5860	1350524825670	5	leneleven ratingfive it's smart and knows what you're going to say!
5861	1350524537300	3	lennine ratingthree the layout of the number keys is really dumb.
5862	1350524537300	3	lenthirteen ratingthree they should be horizontal but they're all clumped together on the left.
5863	1350524235307	5	leneighteen ratingfive an excellent application that has a crazy ability to learn your typing habits and predict your next words.
5864	1350523357865	3	lentwo ratingthree awesome keyboard.
5865	1350523357865	3	lenseventeen ratingthree the keyboard is awesome and the features are amazing but recently i've been having keyboard lag.
5866	1350523357865	3	lensixteen ratingthree there is a slight delay when a hit the keyboard and then the letters show up.
5867	1350523357865	3	lenseventeen ratingthree it does not do this on my galaxy nexus but it does do it on my tmobile gs2 t989.
5868	1350523357865	3	lenseven ratingthree 5 stars when the lag gets fixed pleaseeee
5869	1350521618499	5	lensix ratingfive definitely an improvement from the stock.
5870	1350517755989	5	lenseven ratingfive my samsung galaxy 3 keyboard auto corrects stupidly.
5871	1350517755989	5	lenfour ratingfive this reads my mind.
5872	1350517755989	5	lensixteen ratingfive get this app if you want to speed type and not worry about typing everything wrong
5873	1350517490702	5	lenseven ratingfive this keyboard helps me out so much.
5874	1350517490702	5	lensixteen ratingfive i was skeptical at first about it but i don't regret buying this at all.
5875	1350517490702	5	leneight ratingfive works awesome can't wait for more themes.
5876	1350515968445	5	lentwo ratingfive awesome stuff
5877	1350514907304	3	lennine ratingthree needs more settings so i can personalize the keyboard.
5878	1350514032802	5	lenthree ratingfive love the keyboard.
5879	1350512486963	5	leneight ratingfive leaps and bounds better than the stock keyboard.
5880	1350512486963	5	lentwentyone ratingfive worth every penny, and one of the few apps i would label as essential to anyone getting a new android phone.
5881	1350511864833	5	lenthree ratingfive excellent keyboard experience!
5882	1350511450446	5	leneight ratingfive worth to be one the top paid app.
5883	1350510036649	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive tried to go back to the standard android keyboard and i realized i didn't know how good this one was until it was gone.
5884	1350508883437	5	lentwo ratingfive amazing app!
5885	1350508883437	5	leneleven ratingfive worth every cent. i will never use the stock keyboard again.
5886	1350508883437	5	lenfive ratingfive the rapid typing is impressive.
5887	1350508883437	5	lenfour ratingfive bring on more themes.
5888	1350508883437	5	lenfive ratingfive love this app more everyday
5889	1350508077113	5	leneleven ratingfive apparently this app has saved me 300 keystrokes in 5 minutes of typing.
5890	1350508077113	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive even if this might be over-singing praises, thanks to this app the typing experience on android just became fun and painless.
5891	1350508077113	5	lenseven ratingfive i would pay 10 times the asking price!
5892	1350506732720	4	lenthirteen ratingfour great keyboard,  just wish there were more color customizations for the keyboard settings.
5893	1350502824039	5	lenseven ratingfive the best keyboard out there hands down!
5894	1350498932371	5	lensixteen ratingfive i just switched from the iphone to the samsung, and the keyboard was driving me crazy.
5895	1350498932371	5	leneight ratingfive i could barely text, let alone text fast.
5896	1350498932371	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i just downloaded this app yesterday and i am super impressed with it.
5897	1350498932371	5	lenfive ratingfive the spell check is amazing.
5898	1350498691886	5	lenfourteen ratingfive the predictive text is uncanny and saves me more time than i can count.
5899	1350498691886	5	leneleven ratingfive an outstanding and indispensable app, worth far more than the cost!
5900	1350496581883	4	leneleven ratingfour i use for both english and portuguese and am very happy.
5901	1350496581883	4	leneleven ratingfour it just won't let me use dots on text views.
5902	1350496581883	4	lentwelve ratingfour in those cases i need to switch to samsung's crappy keyboard.
5903	1350495875348	5	lenfive ratingfive i absolutely love this keyboard.
5904	1350495875348	5	leneleven ratingfive but won't  stay as default when start up or reboot?
5905	1350495875348	5	lenfive ratingfive always reverts to stock keyboard.
5906	1350494162646	4	lentwenty ratingfour only thing, every now and then, it won't type, you have to go back to inbox and start again.
5907	1350494132732	1	lenfifteen ratingone constantly crashes, slows down the phone, and uninstalls active language to force internet connection establishment.
5908	1350494132732	1	lenten ratingone this app shouldn't require constant internet connection to work.
5909	1350493939182	4	lenthirtyfour ratingfour i think i'm going to like this program very much, in fact i typed this entire comment by speaking into my phone, 100 percent accuracy, i feel like a kid in a candy store.
5910	1350493939182	4	leneleven ratingfour update : something strangely not preemptive, still better than anything out there.
5911	1350493245103	5	lenseven ratingfive best key board i have ever tried!
5912	1350493245103	5	lenseven ratingfive and i have tried alot of um
5913	1350490470721	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i write frequently in three different languages and this thing just gets it right.
5914	1350490470721	4	lentwenty ratingfour i can even mix languages within a single sentence, like when using names of people or stores, and it works.
5915	1350490470721	4	leneighteen ratingfour the only thing it needs desperately is a different sound theme, because the old typewriter one is pathetic.
5916	1350490470721	4	lentwelve ratingfour this is a must for devices without haptic feedback like the nexus 7.
5917	1350490470721	4	leneight ratingfour i'll give 5 stars once that is fixed.
5918	1350489308756	2	leneight ratingtwo smooth as butter when is at its best .
5919	1350489308756	2	lentwenty ratingtwo but lags like hell often when u wake up the phone after deep sleep and feel like smashing my phone .
5920	1350489308756	2	lenfive ratingtwo using thumbs keyboard rt now .
5921	1350489308756	2	leneleven ratingtwo not as good as swiftkey but atleast it doesn't lag .
5922	1350488168319	3	lensix ratingthree i'm missing the swipe function.
5923	1350488168319	3	leneight ratingthree very overrated keyboard in general in my opinion.
5924	1350487967841	5	lennine ratingfive this keyboard saved me time and tons of typos.
5925	1350485546568	4	lenthirteen ratingfour great app but needs to be a little more customizable, or more themes.
5926	1350484597570	5	leneleven ratingfive love this app it is so cleaver, keep it up swiftkey!
5927	1350482684212	5	lensixtynine ratingfive i've had this app now for three years and it just gets better and better, although i purchased it as just swiftkey they have never changed me for any updates and now obviously it's swiftkey 3, it saves you so much time as it knows what you're typing because it gets use to the way you type and predicts the next words, just the best by far.
5928	1350481595645	1	lensixteen ratingone i have loved using swift key and even payed for the upgrade just to support them.
5929	1350481595645	1	lensixteen ratingone but the last three days  it hasnt worked because it cant download the english language pack!
5930	1350481365725	5	lenfour ratingfive in a word.brilliant!
5931	1350481365725	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i was without this for a day or so and was lost.highly recommend!
5932	1350481195165	3	leneleven ratingthree went back to the samsung keyboard in a matter of minutes.
5933	1350480448543	5	lenten ratingfive the predictive texting for rapid texters is close to perfection.
5934	1350472728142	5	leneight ratingfive great, one of the best keyboard for android.
5935	1350468516954	5	lentwo ratingfive absolutely brilliant
5936	1350467200855	3	lentwelve ratingthree lags a lot and also reverts to samsung keyboard after every reboot.
5937	1350463873828	4	lenfour ratingfour good typing tool, but.
5938	1350463873828	4	lenthirtyfour ratingfour i like the multi-character key concept, for popular punctuation marks, and i would like to suggest more, a selection of quotation marks, right facing-left facing, possibly standard, and elaborate as standards allow.
5939	1350463873828	4	lenseventeen ratingfour also, a selection of copyright and trademark symbols , â©, this very important key is currently; hard to find.
5940	1350463873828	4	lentwentyfour ratingfour this vital key should be front and center considering the level of proprietary issues, that arise; daily, from social media postings; from general observational
5941	1350462814499	4	lenfive ratingfour perfect if support chinese input
5942	1350461872549	5	lenfive ratingfive title basically says it all.
5943	1350461872549	5	lennine ratingfive it would definitely be the first thing to install.
5944	1350461872549	5	lenseven ratingfive makes typing ridiculously fast and highly customizable.
5945	1350459473673	4	leneleven ratingfour is there anyway swift key can create a red color theme?
5946	1350459473673	4	lenseven ratingfour for the keyboard on the next update?
5947	1350458445517	1	lentwentytwo ratingone its seems like my sift key hangs completely when i try and type more than 3 words on watsapp, please fix :(  running s2 ics
5948	1350458370482	5	lentwelve ratingfive evo 3d works awesome, got a new razr max and it is horrible!
5949	1350458370482	5	lenthirteen ratingfive but since upgrading to swift 3 the awesome app is back in use again!
5950	1350458370482	5	lentwo ratingfive thank god!
5951	1350458370482	5	lensixteen ratingfive whatever you did fixed the bug on the razr maxx worked and couldn't be happier!
5952	1350458058302	5	lenfifteen ratingfive had trial version, liked it so bought the full version and so far so good.
5953	1350458058302	5	leneight ratingfive luv the themes it matches color of phone.
5954	1350458058302	5	lenseven ratingfive lol no complaints this way,  great job.
5955	1350458058302	5	lensix ratingfive a must have for touch screen :)
5956	1350455021578	5	lenseven ratingfive tried this before - wasn't that good.
5957	1350455021578	5	lenseven ratingfive tried it again, and it's amazing!
5958	1350455021578	5	lentwentythree ratingfive not sure what's different this time round, but the speed and accuracy of the auto correct leaves everything else in the dust.
5959	1350455021578	5	leneight ratingfive i literally can't fault this, well done.
5960	1350451470931	3	lensix ratingthree i had this app at 5 stars.
5961	1350451470931	3	lenfour ratingthree the question mark change?
5962	1350451470931	3	lenthirteen ratingthree this is from someone that would praise this app to everyone i meet.
5963	1350451184203	5	lennineteen ratingfive i normally would not pay this much for an application but this is definitely one of the better keyboards.
5964	1350449149472	5	lenseventeen ratingfive it is elegant and works well but i have just bought slideit and works better for me
5965	1350448865158	5	lennine ratingfive it's so accurate its crazy i love it!
5966	1350445458225	5	leneighteen ratingfive amazingly accurate, nimble, impossible to go back to any other keyboard after you get used to this one.
5967	1350445277564	4	lenthree ratingfour love the keyboard.
5968	1350445277564	4	lenfour ratingfour the prediction is amazing!
5969	1350445277564	4	lenten ratingfour it just doesn't quite measure up to smart keyboard.
5970	1350444457295	4	lentwelve ratingfour i like it would love it if it had swipe option though
5971	1350444138321	5	lenseven ratingfive couldn't ask for a better keyboard.
5972	1350444138321	5	leneleven ratingfive i really like the feel of it and the different themes.
5973	1350444138321	5	lenfour ratingfive totally worth the money!
5974	1350442665434	4	lensixteen ratingfour it's a really good keyboard, however i feel like there needs to be more themes.
5975	1350442144385	3	lenten ratingthree the space that inserts after a punctuation is fairly annoying.
5976	1350442144385	3	lentwentyone ratingthree i'm used to typing in the space bar after a sentence,  so an update on this issue would be nice.
5977	1350442144385	3	lenseven ratingthree other than that,  its a great keyboard.
5978	1350442144385	3	lentwelve ratingthree (as you notice,  there's a few double spaces in this review.)
5979	1350441069234	5	lenseven ratingfive without doubt, the best keyboard so far.
5980	1350441069234	5	lenfive ratingfive any i've tried several.
5981	1350441069234	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive probably you can remove the auto-cap for the suggestions portion because it is kinda irritating to have an upper case word in the middle of the sentence.
5982	1350440828525	3	lenfive ratingthree where is the swype feature?
5983	1350440828525	3	leneleven ratingthree the keyboard is great, but hard to use with one hand.
5984	1350439832726	5	lensixteen ratingfive i live everything aboutthis app, missed it a lot when i didn't have my evo 4g
5985	1350435081276	5	lenfive ratingfive i am a beautiful person.
5986	1350435081276	5	lenfive ratingfive best keyboard app there is.
5987	1350435081276	5	lenfive ratingfive i am a beautiful person.
5988	1350432138087	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive it make life so much easier when you can type and not have to keep going back over to check if your text is all spelt cirrectly.
5989	1350432138087	5	lentwo ratingfive htc sensation.
5990	1350431855001	4	lentwo ratingfour favorite keyboard
5991	1350430959037	5	lennineteen ratingfive i got the free trial and after using it for just a few hours i bought the full version.
5992	1350430959037	5	lentwentyseven ratingfive i don't find the keyboard layout all that unique (and the number pad takes some getting used to), but the predictive text is second to none.
5993	1350430959037	5	lentwentyone ratingfive it makes all of my messages and email so much quicker and i don't think i could go back now!
5994	1350428683753	4	lenseven ratingfour like the way it's steadily improving.
5995	1350428683753	4	lenten ratingfour wish you guys would add the japanese support, much needed.
5996	1350425190629	5	lenfour ratingfive sensible design, beautifully executed.
5997	1350424115609	5	leneighteen ratingfive i've had 3 android devices and 3 ios devices and i've never come across a keyboard like this.
5998	1350424115609	5	lenthirtyseven ratingfive it's pretty decent straight from the start but the more you use it, the more it learns from you and within a few days i'm typing better than i ever have from a touchscreen device
5999	1350422633650	5	lensix ratingfive should be on every android device.
6000	1350420683078	5	lennine ratingfive i can't believe i havnt got this before.
6001	1350419727740	2	lenthree ratingtwo vie ihan jã¤rettã¶mã¤sti muistia.
6002	1350419727740	2	lenfive ratingtwo asetuksista voi sã¤ã¤tã¤ã¤ tuota automaatti korjausta.
6003	1350419727740	2	lensixteen ratingtwo siksi vie muistia kun oppii paljon, jopa kokonaisia lauserakenteita.  -hukkaa ajoittain kielipaketin. -sanoja ei voi selata.
6004	1350419727740	2	leneleven ratingtwo ipn kirjoittaminen hankalaa kun laittaa pisteen niin menee numeroista takaisin kirjaimiin.
6005	1350418746239	4	lensixteen ratingfour but it's not sufficiently better than the stock jelly bean keyboard to warrant its price.
6006	1350416982981	4	leneight ratingfour with the s3 in portrait, i can actually type!
6007	1350416982981	4	leneleven ratingfour also the hold touch for punctuation and the smileys is amazing!
6008	1350416982981	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour with my s3 though, they keyboard tends to freeze alot, and stay held on a button so it types 4 words in a row, or continually deletes.
6009	1350416982981	4	leneleven ratingfour samsung galaxy s3 model - sgh 1747m small nuisance, will give 5 stars when fixed
6010	1350415342429	5	lenfour ratingfive this keyboard is amazing.
6011	1350415342429	5	lensix ratingfive i've never mistyped a word.
6012	1350415342429	5	lenfour ratingfive much faster than t9 trace.
6013	1350415342429	5	lenfour ratingfive i highly recommend it.
6014	1350413756614	2	lenten ratingtwo please make it an option to have pop up keys.
6015	1350413756614	2	lennine ratingtwo it slows it down and makes it really laggy.
6016	1350413756614	2	lenfourteen ratingtwo please do this i've asked three times and i haven't got anything.
6017	1350413756614	2	leneight ratingtwo i will rate 5 star since this is added.
6018	1350411526786	4	lennine ratingfour that's the only gripe i have about swiftkey.
6019	1350411526786	4	lentwentyeight ratingfour yes, they put a few new themes in since the last iteration, but it could really benefit from the keyboard skin selection already out on the android market.
6020	1350410364248	5	lenfive ratingfive best app i have bought!
6021	1350410364248	5	leneight ratingfive only thing missing for me is a <3 emoticon.
6022	1350405338356	5	lensix ratingfive best keyboard for any droid phone!
6023	1350398868612	1	lenseven ratingone constantly stuck with small font on keys.
6024	1350398868612	1	lensix ratingone font doesn't change with theme.
6025	1350398868612	1	lenseven ratingone predictive text doesn't work in browser.
6026	1350398868612	1	lenfive ratingone needs word competition point option.
6027	1350398868612	1	lenfour ratingone punctuation key is annoying.
6028	1350398868612	1	lennine ratingone please give option for tighter or old keyboard layout.
6029	1350398868612	1	lenfive ratingone arrow keys are unnecessarily large.
6030	1350398868612	1	lenfive ratingone excellent before update to ics.
6031	1350398868612	1	lenthirteen ratingone text boxes in browsers are lost under keyboard, as are password & other fields.
6032	1350398868612	1	lensix ratingone predictive text works intermittently in apps.
6033	1350398868612	1	lenseven ratingone no longer remembers sentences or predicts hashtags.
6034	1350393978143	1	lenfive ratingone this is a harsh review.
6035	1350393978143	1	lentwentyseven ratingone the keyboard layout cannot be modified to suit the user, thus the odd placement of numbers, symbols, and other buttons become frustrating to try to adjust to.
6036	1350393978143	1	lenthirteen ratingone take the numbers: usually lined up across the top after you press the "123"
6037	1350393978143	1	lenthirteen ratingone instead you get the numbers displayed as if you were holding a blackberry.
6038	1350393978143	1	leneleven ratingone who thought this was a great idea to force onto people?
6039	1350393978143	1	lenfifteen ratingone other issues are the lack of a user dictionary and the overaggressive autocorrect omitting words.
6040	1350391115959	1	lenfourteen ratingone it repeats the download process from the beginning every time the screen goes off.
6041	1350391115959	1	lennine ratingone a headache if your connection is slow like mine.
6042	1350390006127	1	lenfour ratingone was expecting more features.
6043	1350390006127	1	lenseven ratingone this keyboard has not got much features.
6044	1350390006127	1	leneight ratingone other keyboards r having a alot of features.
6045	1350390006127	1	lensix ratingone what's a wrong swiftkey people.
6046	1350390006127	1	lenfive ratingone knock knock. :o stil sleeping.
6047	1350390006127	1	lennine ratingone and 30 to 40 mb is too much for a keyboard.
6048	1350390006127	1	lensix ratingone at least for mobiles with 512mb ram.
6049	1350389654477	3	lennine ratingthree currently running android 4.1.2 and notice definite lag when typing.
6050	1350389654477	3	lensixteen ratingthree key press on screen comes after touching the soft key and moving on to the next.
6051	1350389654477	3	lenseven ratingthree backspace is often triggered as well randomly.
6052	1350389654477	3	lenseventeen ratingthree no calibration option makes it a current poor choice for those running the latest and greatest os.
6053	1350389654477	3	lenfourteen ratingthree additionally, the default keyboard is often reset to the android system keyboard upon reboot.
6054	1350389007973	3	lenfiftythree ratingthree better than the original keys, would be better if you could customize the positions and sizes of the keys and remove some of the un used ones,  and i would like to end this review if could put the keyboard back down cos the keyboard is hiding the post buttons in portrait mode.
6055	1350388781932	5	lenfour ratingfive worth spending money on.
6056	1350388566959	5	lentwo ratingfive great settings!
6057	1350388566959	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this application.
6058	1350388566959	5	lenfive ratingfive neon keyboard is the best!
6059	1350383833595	1	lenfour ratingone useless on the galaxy s3
6060	1350375524558	3	lenthirteen ratingthree if it had swype capability it would be worth the money i paid.
6061	1350375524558	3	lenthirteen ratingthree i decided not to use it after one day of frustration without swype.
6062	1350375524558	3	leneleven ratingthree i am too use to sliding my finger to type now.
6063	1350374055056	1	lentwentyone ratingone now it's slow and laggy, has glitchy predictions (especially when hitting delete/backspace), no theming support, and weird cursor jumping.
6064	1350374055056	1	lennineteen ratingone go support a keyboard that will focus on what users actually want and fix bugs in a timely fashion.
6065	1350373089558	1	lensix ratingone this app uses 30mb of my ram!
6066	1350372947619	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive didn't quite understand why people needed extra keyboards since i found the default ones fine but swiftkey is actually really precise.
6067	1350372947619	5	leneleven ratingfive just wish there was a japanese language pack and more themes.
6068	1350370697664	1	lenfourteen ratingone the default keyboard setting for swiftkey is going away when i remove the battery.
6069	1350370697664	1	lenfive ratingone fix this, get five stars.
6070	1350369530086	4	lensix ratingfour perfect keyboard minus a couple things.
6071	1350369530086	4	lensixteen ratingfour predictive text would be great while typing at anytime on the phone, not just for sms.
6072	1350369530086	4	lentwenty ratingfour button on the space bar while on the web an option, because personally, it gets in the way a lot.
6073	1350369530086	4	lentwentysix ratingfour now to be fair, if i missed these options somewhere in the settings, please tell me, if not, it would be quite helpful to update it.
6074	1350369530086	4	leneight ratingfour overall, excellent keyboard and love the different themes.
6075	1350368451576	5	leneleven ratingfive i love it better than the one came with the phone
6076	1350367221448	5	lenten ratingfive the only keyboard anyone will need with a android phone
6077	1350364936270	3	leneleven ratingthree i really want a dedicated quotation mark button,  and more themes.
6078	1350359600686	5	lenfour ratingfive this is seriously amazing.
6079	1350359600686	5	lentwenty ratingfive i am typing this on it and it almost always predicts the next word with only a few key strokes.
6080	1350359600686	5	lennine ratingfive i love it swype has nothing on swift key 3.
6081	1350359242146	4	lentwelve ratingfour i absolutely love this keyboard, an amazing replacement for the awful stock.
6082	1350359242146	4	lenfifteen ratingfour however it seems to me that it uses a bit much ram for a keyboard.
6083	1350359242146	4	lensix ratingfour seems a bit steep, amazing otherwise.
6084	1350358798783	4	lenthirteen ratingfour it needs an emoji plug in so i can delete garbage go keyboard
6085	1350357771718	5	lenfour ratingfive predicts text unbelievably well.
6086	1350357771718	5	lenfour ratingfive definitely recommend the download.
6087	1350355528869	5	lenfive ratingfive it is amazing, i recommend!
6088	1350351928957	4	lenseven ratingfour this does save you from many keystrokes.
6089	1350351928957	4	lenthree ratingfour worth the money!
6090	1350349379580	5	lensix ratingfive i love my new samsung galaxy s3!
6091	1350349379580	5	leneleven ratingfive however,  the keyboard system that comes with touchwiz sucks pretty bad!
6092	1350349379580	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive even worse when you have two or three languages,  you need to keep switching all that time :-(  for only $0.99! you can solve all your problems ;-)!
6093	1350349379580	5	lenten ratingfive simple to use, swiftkey 3 is a huge surprise to me.
6094	1350349379580	5	lenthirtythree ratingfive it works perfectly using two languages at the same time without switching to one to another.  ;-)  and when you type a wrong word it fixes to the one that you were looking for!
6095	1350345942098	1	lenninetyone ratingone so i bought when it was on the end of the summer sale and thought it was something helpful at least at first anyway now i feel absolutely different about and seriously annoyed with it constantly putting a choose input method message in the updates bar i select it, it goes into its options menu and i thumb through it only to realize nothing has changed its set as defaulted input method and all other options are correctly selected not to mention it predictions method sucks totally changes correctly spelled wo
6096	1350345644637	1	lenforty ratingone there is a (known) issue for jellybean which causes the stock keyboard to reset every time the phone is switched on, so i need to manually go into settings and set keyboard to swiftkey every time i restart my phone.
6097	1350345644637	1	leneighteen ratingone regardless of whether this is a developer issue or google issue, it's unacceptable in a paid app.
6098	1350345601322	5	lennine ratingfive dictionary remembers singlish as well like leh, lah, lor.
6099	1350342854161	5	lenfour ratingfive swift key is awesome.
6100	1350342854161	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive i'm a fast typist and i miss the mark on most android keyboards but swift key picks up what i'm typing flawlessly i wouldn't recommend any other keyboard.
6101	1350341063259	5	leneighteen ratingfive got this for pennies when it was on offer and would easily have paid full price for it.
6102	1350341063259	5	lennineteen ratingfive really good and totally customizable so do spend a minute or two setting it up to suit your needs.
6103	1350341063259	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive hated my touch screen phone till i put this app on and now i'm very well impressed and love my we galaxy y
6104	1350340345032	5	lensix ratingfive saves a substantial number of keystrokes.
6105	1350339100334	5	lenthirtytwo ratingfive i've recently switched from iphones to android, i've been blown away by the jelly bean os and have realised apple give you a fraction of the useabilty of the system.
6106	1350339100334	5	lenseventeen ratingfive but the standard keyboard on jelly bean really sucks in so far as auto correcting your inputting.
6107	1350339100334	5	lenfifteen ratingfive it would let me sent nonsense words i've mistyped, something the iphone auto corrected.
6108	1350339100334	5	lenthirteen ratingfive swift key not only auto corrects but it learns from your typing style.
6109	1350339100334	5	lenthirteen ratingfive â£2.99 is a bargain for the ease of typing that i'm used to.
6110	1350338308092	5	lenfiftyfive ratingfive i was always a blackberry person, and i have changed to more powerful smart phones for lots of reasons,  but the one thing i missed was the key board on blackberry, and i have tried lots of key pad apps but this is the best  and nearest to my blackberry experience for sure, great job
6111	1350335237416	3	lennine ratingthree uses too much ram and slows down phone drastically
6112	1350334394548	5	lentwelve ratingfive i love this keyboard its the best 4 dollars i have ever spent.
6113	1350333070857	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i've only been using it for a few minutes now but i've never typed this fast on any phone before.
6114	1350333070857	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i love how i can have it detect three languages at any time.
6115	1350333070857	5	lenthree ratingfive money well spent.
6116	1350332841367	5	lensix ratingfive better than stock keyboard, love it.
6117	1350332841367	5	lennine ratingfive lots of customization but would like to see more.
6118	1350331601412	4	lennine ratingfour awesome keyboard,,  we need new theme and costume theme.!
6119	1350330078845	3	lenthirtyone ratingthree suggestions are awesome, but not many things annoy me as much as when i type something and swiftkey changes it to something wrong even though i didn't choose a suggtion.
6120	1350329649715	5	lenseven ratingfive quick prediction and great support for arabic
6121	1350328239480	5	lensix ratingfive chrome + swiftkey = constant freeze and crash.
6122	1350327911498	5	lensix ratingfive very useful and easy to use.
6123	1350327911498	5	lenseven ratingfive it's definitely worth purchasing and using.
6124	1350321436646	4	lentwelve ratingfour much much better than the factory android keyboard that came with my s3.
6125	1350321436646	4	lenten ratingfour i still find it much worse than my iphone was.
6126	1350321436646	4	lensix ratingfour it butchers words pretty bad sometimes.
6127	1350321436646	4	lentwentysix ratingfour i purely base my opinions on how often i have to go back and fix mistakes that either i've made and it didn't fix.
6128	1350321436646	4	lentwentyfive ratingfour or words it just completely butcher's. it bothers me when i do spell words correctly and it still changes them to an irrelevant word.
6129	1350321436646	4	lenfourteen ratingfour i'm not basing my opinion off gimmicky things that the keyboards can do.
6130	1350320651939	1	lenseven ratingone so many useless symbols but no backtick (`)?!
6131	1350320651939	1	lenten ratingone the whole number/symbol entry screen needs to be redone.
6132	1350320651939	1	lenfourteen ratingone also: pressing a punctuation key needs to accept the prediction, then insert that symbol.
6133	1350320651939	1	lenfifteen ratingone we also want custom gestures (paste, select all, move cursor, etc) and changeable detection sensitivity.
6134	1350319303481	4	lentwentythree ratingfour needs swype,  sometimes doubles on letters, hate the fact that a space automatically equals a period but overall very impressive and worth my $
6135	1350317580083	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive texting is so much easier and accurate with the word selection choices and the app's ability to learn frequently used words.
6136	1350317580083	5	leneight ratingfive once i figured it out.i love it!
6137	1350317580083	5	lennineteen ratingfive you can also set it for spell checker but it doesn't automatically insert what it thinks you mean.
6138	1350317580083	5	lentwenty ratingfive you can set it to suggest-- but it doesn't override what you type in if you choose that option.
6139	1350316824226	1	leneight ratingone keyboard keeps resetting back to default on reboot.
6140	1350316824226	1	leneleven ratingone it's getting tedious setting swiftkey as my keyboard each time.
6141	1350316824226	1	lentwelve ratingone love this app but for the moment it's too much work.
6142	1350316727072	5	lenfive ratingfive simply does an amazing job
6143	1350314987063	3	lenthirteen ratingthree this is without doubt one of (if not) the best keyboards available today.
6144	1350314987063	3	lenseventeen ratingthree but one major flaw on this for a fast typer is the lack of multi touch support.
6145	1350314987063	3	leneighteen ratingthree that's also the reason i also purchased thumb keyboard and is writing this review on that keyboard.
6146	1350314987063	3	lenfortyfive ratingthree i tend to type very fast, and when i press a key on the right side of the keyboard, and immediately press a key on the left side, swiftkey assumes i'm deleting a word.also for the love of god, give us keyboard shortcuts!
6147	1350313330016	5	lennineteen ratingfive works so well you hardly notice what it's doing, which is exactly what you want with a keyboard.
6148	1350313330016	5	leneight ratingfive prediction is great and different themes are good.
6149	1350313330016	5	lennineteen ratingfive this is how stock keyboards should work, samsung and the likes take note should be standard on all phones.
6150	1350311097374	5	lenthirteen ratingfive a separate tablet app i have to purchase in addition to regular swiftkey?
6151	1350311097374	5	lentwelve ratingfive otherwise an excellent keyboard with excellent predictive text and excellent spell check.
6152	1350311097374	5	leneleven ratingfive there is a very slight slowdown while typing at times though.
6153	1350311097374	5	lensixteen ratingfive not sure what is causing it but fix that and you will have pure keyboard perfection!
6154	1350307203875	5	lenfour ratingfive great keyboard, very accurate!
6155	1350307203875	5	lensixteen ratingfive just try and go back to a default keyboard after using this trial for a month.
6156	1350307177255	1	lentwelve ratingone doesn't predict swears, custom words, or abbreviations w/ symbols (ie. "w/").
6157	1350307177255	1	leneight ratingone also, would love the ability to customize emotes.
6158	1350307177255	1	lenfive ratingone key press sounds are obnoxious.
6159	1350305416333	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive got this a while back in the sale for 25p but had then got a iphone , but changed back to android recently , so installed again on my htc desire .
6160	1350305416333	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i have allowed the app access to facebook and twitter and also my sms messages to learn my style of writing .
6161	1350305416333	5	lensixteen ratingfive wow its like it knows what i am about to wrote before i even write it .
6162	1350305416333	5	lenseven ratingfive saves me so much time and effort .
6163	1350305416333	5	lenthirteen ratingfive well worth the price it is now but for 25p it was a steal .
6164	1350305239289	4	lenten ratingfour the keyboard doesn't disappear and appear as it should.
6165	1350305239289	4	lenten ratingfour add a hide keyboard button or fix response time please.
6166	1350305239289	4	lensix ratingfour this keyboard setup and functions kicks @$$
6167	1350304609917	2	lentwentytwo ratingtwo bon logiciel, un peu cher et pas trã¨s rã©actif : ã§a fait plus de 2 ans que nous demandons un clavier bã©po pour le franã§ais et rien ne bouge.
6168	1350304013923	3	lenfour ratingthree chinese character not included.
6169	1350304013923	3	lensix ratingthree hope to see an update soon.
6170	1350288573910	3	leneleven ratingthree doesn't learn some of the words that i've type.
6171	1350288573910	3	lensixteen ratingthree and for god sake why don't you put an option to turn off "family filter"
6172	1350288573910	3	lensixteen ratingthree so i can write properly instead of seeing duck everytime i want to write something else.
6173	1350288573910	3	lenfive ratingthree it's a normal keyboard.
6174	1350281743045	4	leneleven ratingfour when it has 2 languages selected it mostly makes predictions in one
6175	1350279500035	4	lentwo ratingfour great keyboard!
6176	1350279500035	4	lenfourteen ratingfour would love to see swype added in the future.would be excellent after that.
6177	1350277286429	5	leneleven ratingfive this is the best keyboard app ever it is so easy!
6178	1350276477429	1	lentwentythree ratingone entering a period always inserts a space after, which cannot be removed (manually removing the space does not work as it gets reinserted).
6179	1350276477429	1	lenthirtyone ratingone this is a huge problem if you have an e-mail address/username/password with periods in them as you have to switch to another keyboard in order to enter them.
6180	1350276477429	1	lentwentysix ratingone once this behavior is fixed i can adjust my rating to five stars - how hard would it be to create an option to disable this behavior?
6181	1350276329738	5	lensixteen ratingfive this is one of those apps that i will never not have on an android device.
6182	1350276329738	5	lenthirtyfive ratingfive it allows you to type so much faster and easier - however, i would like more themes and maybe something along the lines of swype to be added in the future for easier one-handed typing.
6183	1350272417498	5	lentwentyone ratingfive i have used this app for about one year and it is by far the best keyboard on any smart phone.
6184	1350272417498	5	lenfifteen ratingfive more important is that we all use the smart phone keyboard more than anything else.
6185	1350272417498	5	lennine ratingfive can't believe how advanced swift has made it.
6186	1350271622563	5	lensixteen ratingfive when i first got my samsung galaxy ii, i hated the keyboard that was on it.
6187	1350271622563	5	leneleven ratingfive soon after, i downloaded swiftkey 3 and i cannot use anything else!
6188	1350271622563	5	lennine ratingfive it seriously makes typing sooo much faster and easier.
6189	1350271622563	5	leneleven ratingfive it learns from what i type and predicts crazy accurate stuff!
6190	1350271607697	5	lentwelve ratingfive one recommendation, allow us to custom color the keyboard would be amazing!
6191	1350271434906	4	lensix ratingfour i really wish it had emojiis
6192	1350269942086	5	lensix ratingfive love it,  but need new themes. :)
6193	1350269303700	5	leneighteen ratingfive i after switching over from iphone to android i hate to say it, but i missed auto correct.
6194	1350269303700	5	lentwelve ratingfive no android has proven once again why i am glad i switch.
6195	1350269303700	5	lenseven ratingfive i don't like something change it.
6196	1350269303700	5	lenseven ratingfive swiftkey is amazing and worth every penny.
6197	1350269303700	5	lenfive ratingfive works even better then apple.
6198	1350269303700	5	lensix ratingfive like eveything else on this phone :)
6199	1350268831435	5	lensix ratingfive this as my default any more.
6200	1350266900724	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this app is far by the best app to get for your mobile phone.
6201	1350266900724	5	lenten ratingfive i myself like the neon theme because it looks cool.
6202	1350266900724	5	lentwelve ratingfive i wish you could still use swype but everything else is awesome
6203	1350266226235	5	lenseven ratingfive would love the ability to customize themes.
6204	1350266226235	5	leneight ratingfive other than that, wouldn't change a thing.
6205	1350264833659	4	leneighteen ratingfour i love this app but after the latest droid update my suggestions no longer show up nor autocorrect.
6206	1350263414962	3	leneleven ratingthree sometimes doesn't work and i have to uninstall and reinstall.
6207	1350263414962	3	lentwo ratingthree otherwise fantastic.
6208	1350263248468	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i love it makes my sms much better for things you get lazy about.
6209	1350261704846	4	lenfifteen ratingfour wish i had options to make font larger on the keys, like a.i. keyboard.
6210	1350261704846	4	leneight ratingfour but this keyboard is more stable and consistent.
6211	1350261664045	5	lenseven ratingfive there isn't a better predictive keyboard!
6212	1350261664045	5	lenten ratingfive i don't buy apps but i bought this one!
6213	1350259884613	5	leneight ratingfive way better than the terrible samsung galaxy s3 keyboard.
6214	1350259884613	5	lenten ratingfive it's way faster and a million times more accurate.
6215	1350259884613	5	lensix ratingfive highly recommend for only four dollars. :-)
6216	1350258536101	5	lenthree ratingfive love this app
6217	1350255010157	5	lenthirteen ratingfive the best keyboard app there is and keeps getting better with each update!
6218	1350254564947	4	lenfive ratingfour has become laggy while typing.
6219	1350254123891	5	lennine ratingfive i don't even have to type any more.
6220	1350254123891	5	lenfive ratingfive best 99 cents i ever spent.
6221	1350253783566	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this app is for people who would like to replace their terrible keyboards.
6222	1350253783566	5	leneight ratingfive do yourself a favor and download this app.
6223	1350253783566	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this is one app that i can honestly say is worth my money.
6224	1350253783566	5	leneight ratingfive the factory keyboard on my galaxy s3 is terrible.
6225	1350253783566	5	lenfourteen ratingfive which is the only reason why i decided to purchase swiftkey 3 from google play.
6226	1350253611190	5	lensix ratingfive way better than the default keyboard!
6227	1350251995924	3	lennine ratingthree this app is awesomeness but not without pro lems.
6228	1350251995924	3	lenfourteen ratingthree such as the keyboard size and the most ssing "b" from the word above.
6229	1350251995924	3	lentwelve ratingthree it also doesn't correct words with a line of nder them.
6230	1350251995924	3	leneight ratingthree you select the correct spelling and nothing happens.
6231	1350251957534	5	leneight ratingfive learns as you type and makes perfect corrections.
6232	1350251957534	5	lensix ratingfive the best keyboard for fast typers.
6233	1350250470409	5	lenten ratingfive i honestly think this is the best keyboard on android.
6234	1350250470409	5	lentwenty ratingfive my favorite option is changing the amount of time for long press since i use the secondary keys a lot.
6235	1350249342623	3	lenfour ratingthree switching to factory keyboard.
6236	1350249342623	3	lenten ratingthree sweftkey force me to correct words so often is annoying.
6237	1350249342623	3	lensixteen ratingthree been using it for more than 3 months, it should have learned my personal lexico by now.
6238	1350249342623	3	lenten ratingthree get it if only $ .99, else i can't recommend it.
6239	1350249131610	3	lenfive ratingthree keyboard layout is marginally better.
6240	1350249131610	3	lenfive ratingthree i expected larger theme sets.
6241	1350249131610	3	lentwelve ratingthree predictions are horrible, though enjoyed the added spaces for commas and periods.
6242	1350249131610	3	lentwelve ratingthree decent keyboard but not enough to warrant a purchase over the stock.
6243	1350242463312	3	lenfour ratingthree waiting for thai languages.
6244	1350242349953	4	lenfour ratingfour really amazing predictive text.
6245	1350242349953	4	lenseven ratingfour the themes just seem a bit limited.
6246	1350242349953	4	lentwenty ratingfour if this app and thumb keyboard could somehow have a baby app, then that would be the best keyboard ever.
6247	1350240267319	5	lenten ratingfive makes the predictions amd corrections with great ease and accuracy!
6248	1350239743042	5	lenfourteen ratingfive i am revising my review to reflect that the problems i had were fixed.
6249	1350239743042	5	lenfive ratingfive this is my favorite keyboard.
6250	1350239743042	5	lentwentyfour ratingfive i just wish it had third party theme support like many of the others as the built in colors don't match my theme.
6251	1350239743042	5	lennineteen ratingfive it's a small problem that shouldn't take away from how well the auto-correct and predictions work.
6252	1350238956420	5	lenfourteen ratingfive this is the best keyboard i have ever used it is the perfect keyboard
6253	1350236324288	4	lenfifteen ratingfour im still missing option for polish dictionary without special characters -  i wish to have "normal"
6254	1350236324288	4	lentwentyone ratingfour letters only as these additional polish (it's not common for polish alphabet) letters take to much data on tex messaging.
6255	1350236324288	4	lentwelve ratingfour i asked for fix good while ago with no update on it.
6256	1350235176856	5	leneight ratingfive wish the keyboard could show gtalk's emoticons.
6257	1350231682089	3	lenfortyone ratingthree its a great app for any tablet or phone, but it will slow down my nexus 7, i removed the app and my nexus has been running smoother, fix the performance and i'll be glad to reinstall it on my tablet
6258	1350231178826	5	lenthirteen ratingfive i can't believe i was using the standard s3 keyboard for so long!
6259	1350231178826	5	lenthirteen ratingfive this thing is simply the best touch screen keyboard i've ever used!
6260	1350230892880	5	leneleven ratingfive it made my transition to a touch screen a lot easier.
6261	1350230892880	5	leneight ratingfive i wish i would have downloaded it earlier!
6262	1350229776097	4	lensixtytwo ratingfour like everything but there is one thing missing what other keyboards have and that is having custom keys for emotion faces and as a 21 century teenager i like to have that option and thinking most teenagers have a smart phone as we are spoilt as hell then i would of thought you would of added this to your app many updates ago!?
6263	1350228483259	5	lenten ratingfive great keyboard with excellent predictions and auto correction.really swift.
6264	1350226508931	5	lentwelve ratingfive i've been using it for a long time and love it.
6265	1350226508931	5	lenseventeen ratingfive lately there's a periodic lag while typing; also not sure about this new smart space thing.
6266	1350225498961	4	lentwentyeight ratingfour great app very easy to use and i love the level of customisation but is does suffer from over sampling the keystrokes while the phone is being charged.
6267	1350224412945	5	lenthirteen ratingfive guess what u r thinking great app wish u could customize it more
6268	1350217358280	5	lentwo ratingfive great keyboard.
6269	1350217358280	5	lentwentyone ratingfive use smart keyboard pro and this, swiftkey is so intuitive and easy to use i am tending to stay with it.
6270	1350217358280	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive if there is a negative comparing the 2 it would be the lack of customisation compared to smart keyboard pro, which is endless!
6271	1350217358280	5	lentwentyfive ratingfive that said, swiftkey is an extremely competent app that gets a deserved 5* from me and a huge well done and thanks to the dev team!
6272	1350217284260	5	lenthirtyone ratingfive completey customizable very efficient works exactly like a keyboard should work very fast and i know because i'm an english major who uses google drive alot for papers and homework.
6273	1350217150899	4	lenfour ratingfour blazing fast, error free.
6274	1350217150899	4	lenseven ratingfour would be perfect with support for japanese.
6275	1350217129088	5	leneighteen ratingfive i used the trial for a month and felt it was so much better than my original keyboard.
6276	1350217129088	5	lensixteen ratingfive unfortunately i got used to how great swiftkey was quickly and then my trial was over.
6277	1350217129088	5	lennineteen ratingfive i switched back to my original android keyboard with auto-correct and my typing went from great to horrible.
6278	1350217129088	5	lentwenty ratingfive going back to the android default made my texting while driving made it 10 times more dangerous than it already is.
6279	1350217129088	5	lentwentyeight ratingfive swiftkey should be thanked, they're saving lives with their app because people who might have a crash from texting now can be relieved with reliable text suggestions.
6280	1350217129088	5	lennine ratingfive definitely recommend to everyone, and as for the themes.
6281	1350217129088	5	leneight ratingfive people need to stop whining, they're great.
6282	1350209400972	5	lenfour ratingfive excellent and very useful!
6283	1350207483013	3	lennine ratingthree i bought this app much earlier with my nexus 7.
6284	1350207483013	3	lenten ratingthree i then i realized that there was a tablet version.
6285	1350207483013	3	leneleven ratingthree i do i need to buy it again for my tablet?
6286	1350207223089	4	leneight ratingfour motorola defy rooted with cm9 rom by jordan installed.
6287	1350206963464	5	lensixteen ratingfive saves me so much time and effort with its super smart spell correction and prediction text.
6288	1350206963464	5	lenfourteen ratingfive only wish i could customize the skin to match the rest of my phone.
6289	1350206327345	5	lentwo ratingfive great app.
6290	1350206327345	5	leneighteen ratingfive between this and swype its even bcuz they both work great and do what their supposed to do.
6291	1350203029809	5	lenfourteen ratingfive makes it possible to write on touchscreen without taking ages, it's so helpful!
6292	1350203029809	5	lensix ratingfive definitely one of my favourite apps!
6293	1350202764542	1	lenfive ratingone "unfortunately, android keyboard has stopped"
6294	1350202764542	1	lennine ratingone j'en ai ras le bol de ce bug!
6295	1350202764542	1	lenfour ratingone please corrigez le asap
6296	1350197722741	5	lenfive ratingfive great prediction and typing app.
6297	1350197722741	5	lennine ratingfive biggest disappointment is the lack of chinese language support.
6298	1350197722741	5	lenthirty ratingfive and it's amazing how much swiftkey is missing out on a 1.2 billion population country, not counting the also very large population outside china who also uses the chinese language.
6299	1350196198774	3	lenthirteen ratingthree typing an email address is a pain in the ass with this app.
6300	1350195319246	3	lenseven ratingthree slow to close when exiting messaging program.
6301	1350195319246	3	lenfive ratingthree really bogs the galaxy s3 down.
6302	1350195319246	3	leneight ratingthree developers need to write better memory / display management.
6303	1350194090757	5	lenseventeen ratingfive it's just great, the looks of keyboards, how it knows what i'm about to type!
6304	1350194090757	5	lentwo ratingfive simple & great!
6305	1350191561609	5	leneight ratingfive best touch screen keyboard i've ever used.
6306	1350191561609	5	lenten ratingfive predictions are changing to your style and tailored to you.
6307	1350190657686	5	lentwelve ratingfive great app was amazed on how it remembers your style of writing.
6308	1350187388152	4	lennine ratingfour only improvement would be the voice to text button.
6309	1350187388152	4	lenfifteen ratingfour make it a stand alone button and make sure it works sometimes with jelly bean.
6310	1350186163348	5	lenseven ratingfive i have absolutely loved everything about this.
6311	1350186163348	5	lenfifteen ratingfive i don't have to worry about making mistakes because it will always fix hit!
6312	1350186163348	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommend!
6313	1350185007010	4	lenfourteen ratingfour would rate 5 stars if it had more color customization for the keyboard, more themes.
6314	1350184251369	4	lentwelve ratingfour one little thing annoys me tho: the auto correct is really stubborn!
6315	1350184251369	4	lentwentynine ratingfour unlike the ics keyboard, backspacing does not get rid of the auto corrected word,  so i'm forced to delete it manually and select it from the suggestion bar.
6316	1350184251369	4	lenten ratingfour until this feature is added,  my rating will stay at 4 ââââ.
6317	1350184251369	4	lenfifteen ratingfour it would also be nice to have more themes or support for third party themes.
6318	1350184251369	4	lenthree ratingfour overall, great keyboard.
6319	1350183579591	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i seriously hated the stock keyboard on my samsung galaxy s3 it was horrible and i couldn't type on it fast at all.
6320	1350183579591	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive i then got swift and i love it soo much well worth the money, and it makes my phone even that better.
6321	1350178480982	1	lenfourteen ratingone this makes tying incredibly slow ans i reverted back to the normal android keyboard.
6322	1350178067391	5	leneight ratingfive after updating to 4.1.2 it gives error when installing
6323	1350176688564	5	lenfour ratingfive i love this app!
6324	1350176688564	5	leneight ratingfive it is way better than the android keyboard!
6325	1350176688564	5	leneight ratingfive the auto correct is amazing and so accurate!
6326	1350174959555	5	lenfifteen ratingfive first review i've bothered to do - getting this app genuinely makes my life easier.
6327	1350174959555	5	leneleven ratingfive much faster sending long emails and the predictive element is awesome.
6328	1350172822288	2	lentwentyone ratingtwo am running ics and it worked good in the 1st couple of days then my phone started to have this hanging problems.
6329	1350172822288	2	lensixteen ratingtwo tryed to send them an email they said search for problem thread or sth like that .
6330	1350172822288	2	lennine ratingtwo i have no time for it 2 stars and uninstalling .
6331	1350172822288	2	lenthree ratingtwo waist of money.
6332	1350170714681	2	lenten ratingtwo why isn't the predictive typing working in dolphin browser?
6333	1350169648224	4	lentwentysix ratingfour good keyboard but the lack of accents is annoying, also that on sms screen the return / next line button defaults to a smiley, otherwise, great keyboard.
6334	1350168750048	4	lentwentyeight ratingfour i'll lower my rating to 4 stars since the jelly bean bug resetting the keyboard to stock at each reboot has been around for long without being fixed.
6335	1350168750048	4	leneight ratingfour cept for that this is my favorite keyboard.
6336	1350167699720	4	lentwenty ratingfour only annoying bug on jb, is that whenever i reboot my phone, the keyboard reverts back to the jb one.
6337	1350167699720	4	lenfour ratingfour better than swipeit keyboard.
6338	1350163123357	3	lenten ratingthree when i had a casio commando, this app was great.
6339	1350163123357	3	leneighteen ratingthree upgraded to an lg intuition and, while it still functions properly, it does not stretch across the screen.
6340	1350163123357	3	lentwenty ratingthree when i use the phone's built in resizing ability, the keyboard is too large to see all the keys.
6341	1350159362910	5	lenfour ratingfive i live this keyboard.
6342	1350159362910	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i have use so many android keyboards and non of them even come close to this one!
6343	1350159362910	5	lentwo ratingfive highly recommend!
6344	1350158877424	4	lentwentynine ratingfour does not function properly when my galaxy note 2 is used horisontally to write email on my office email account (exhange server -  using original samsung email app being pre installed) .
6345	1350158877424	4	leneight ratingfour text is jumping up and down when writing!
6346	1350158877424	4	leneight ratingfour other than that,  this is a brilliant app:)
6347	1350158702502	5	leneighteen ratingfive i've downloaded what feels like a dozen keyboards and all of them just weren't quite right.
6348	1350158702502	5	lentwentynine ratingfive this one on the other hand has absolutely excellent predictive text and a great keyboard layout that makes typing easier so i hit the right letter the first time.
6349	1350158644584	1	lentwentyone ratingone hate hate hate that it inserts spaces when typing an email.address with a full stop in them.annoying as hell!
6350	1350158144492	5	lenfive ratingfive but use alot of ram
6351	1350155828394	2	lentwentyseven ratingtwo this is the best featured keyboard i've used so far but the lag when typing in many apps makes it almost unusable and very very frustrating.
6352	1350155828394	2	lennine ratingtwo the developer does not seem to address the issue.
6353	1350155286513	4	lentwelve ratingfour this is really good and 98% accurate since i'm a rapid typer.
6354	1350155286513	4	leneleven ratingfour thank god for android sale i bought it at ard sgd1+ awesome!
6355	1350155286513	4	lenseven ratingfour i wonder if swipe feature is available.
6356	1350155286513	4	lenfive ratingfour i would gv it 5 stars!
6357	1350154832076	4	lenfortythree ratingfour i love the keyboard my only problem with it is when i have it on it doesnt allow for me to get notification noises or vibrations for text messages even though it says that it is set up right and should be working.
6358	1350154832076	4	lenten ratingfour if that could be fixed i would rate this 5 stars
6359	1350153091352	1	lentwentyfive ratingone why list this product as compatible with the google nexus 7 tablet if the first thing you see when you start the app is "wrong swiftkey"!
6360	1350153091352	1	lenseventeen ratingone unfortunately, it took me a while before trying it out and i cannot get a refund now.
6361	1350153091352	1	lentwenty ratingone it sucks too that they offer to get the tablet version instead, but of course, you have to pay again.
6362	1350152403976	4	leneight ratingfour i can't type without this swift :-o
6363	1350150616329	5	lentwentythree ratingfive one thing i'd like to see is for it to change back to the keyboard after hitting the space bar in the "123"
6364	1350149636908	1	lenfourteen ratingone for some reason, my nexus s defaults to samsung keyboard and it really annoys.
6365	1350148282271	5	lentwelve ratingfive love the keyboard would be nice to have themes you can customize.
6366	1350148202794	1	leneight ratingone keyboard appears but the actual swiping is broken.
6367	1350148202794	1	leneleven ratingone i've used it before and it's a great app.
6368	1350147936284	5	lenfourteen ratingfive seriously everyone who don't have this buy it, it's soo worth it!
6369	1350144896402	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i have owned 5 smart phones and without question this is the best keyboard i have ever used.
6370	1350142844967	5	lenfifteen ratingfive it is intelligent enough to really learn what im saying and how i say it.
6371	1350141738660	2	lenthirtynine ratingtwo i watched the video and read everything but on the lg thrill it makes me type slower and to be honest isn't a good keyboard i like the color changes you can do but honestly its a pain.
6372	1350141738660	2	lensix ratingtwo i'm gonna un install it.
6373	1350140308371	3	leneight ratingthree i use apostrophes and dot com a lot.
6374	1350140308371	3	lenthirtyfive ratingthree it would be good if this paid for app would be a bit more configurable ie allow me to add an apostrophe on the main keyboard rather than have to go to the supplementary one
6375	1350139641256	5	lenfourteen ratingfive ok amazing app i love this look try it it will plow your mind.
6376	1350139641256	5	lenseventeen ratingfive you have fifteen minutes to return it you won't you will be in love by then.
6377	1350139641256	5	leneleven ratingfive well worth the money hate i lived without it so long!.
6378	1350139641256	5	lentwentythree ratingfive i had this a few months now still wow amazed with it can't help but love this app try it trust me!
6379	1350138651809	4	leneleven ratingfour ok so it's a great keyboard, the best on android.
6380	1350138651809	4	lensixteen ratingfour but needs to be able to learn words better, or choose to assume curse words manually.
6381	1350138651809	4	lentwelve ratingfour ridiculous that assessment, bit cheaper, shot, duck, and see are all changed.
6382	1350138651809	4	lenthirteen ratingfour let me control that, stop this pretentious nonsense world where no one swears
6383	1350137864338	4	lenfifteen ratingfour my only gripe is that there is no euro key and i live in spain!
6384	1350137864338	4	lenthree ratingfour hence only 4 stars.
6385	1350133707002	4	lenten ratingfour this really does learn and saves me loads of time.
6386	1350132029064	5	lenthirteen ratingfive it's easier to write on this keyboard than on full computer one.
6387	1350132029064	5	lentwenty ratingfive it remembers how you write and after some time of usage it automagically suggests and complete your words and sentences.
6388	1350132029064	5	lenten ratingfive i and everyone i told about this keyboard loves it.
6389	1350131451466	3	lenseven ratingthree needs bigger keys and more neon colors.
6390	1350128979274	5	lenten ratingfive great,  only need to type about 15 characters for this sentence :-)
6391	1350127566065	5	lensixteen ratingfive took the trial didn't upgrade for a week decided i couldn't live without it!
6392	1350119422443	2	lenthirteen ratingtwo try to type some email addresses and you will know what l mean.
6393	1350119422443	2	lensix ratingtwo not all words needs smart space.
6394	1350119422443	2	lenten ratingtwo it becomes more of a nuisance instead of a features.
6395	1350117146693	5	lenten ratingfive you'll understand why when you stop being tight lol.
6396	1350117146693	5	lenfive ratingfive honestly though this is amazing.
6397	1350113393744	5	lenseven ratingfive best keyboard on the market to date.
6398	1350113393744	5	lenseventeen ratingfive i've been using it for months and i can't imagine going back to anything else.
6399	1350113393744	5	lentwentytwo ratingfive great predictions, good looks, handy gestures, you'll be hard pressed to find a keyboard that does this better than swift key
6400	1350109984120	5	lensixteen ratingfive this keyboard allows me to type like i was on an iphone (which is still garbage)
6401	1350107910395	4	lenfourteen ratingfour but three quid is a very steep and would be better with more skins.
6402	1350107910395	4	lenten ratingfour would be 5 star if it was less than a pound
6403	1350107852384	4	lentwelve ratingfour man what a great upgrade to the factory keyboard on the phone.
6404	1350107852384	4	lenseven ratingfour i am a want a be texter.
6405	1350107852384	4	lenthirteen ratingfour i used the trial version of swiftkey 3 for a month and loved it.
6406	1350107852384	4	lenfour ratingfour made typing much easier.
6407	1350107852384	4	lentwentyone ratingfour i have had a smartphone since they first came out and this is the first app i have ever paid for.
6408	1350107852384	4	lenfour ratingfour well worth the money!
