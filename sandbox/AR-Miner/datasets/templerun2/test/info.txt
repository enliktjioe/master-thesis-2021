lennineteen ratingone i have a samsung infuse and it jus stays on the first screen and then jus closes it self.
leneleven ratingone loved the game until it wouldn't let me open it.
lentwentytwo ratingone it keeps freezing whenever i try to change settings and whenever i try to quit the game and go to the menu.
lensixteen ratingfour nest game ever but ir a bit hard to see when you have to turn corners
lentwelve ratingone it force closes at the beginning never got a chance to play

lenseven ratingone have downloaded twice, but it wont open.  : (
lennineteen ratingone i installed this game and it won't open, it just closes down and back to my home page.
lensixteen ratingone every time i try to play it just stays on the intro screen plz fix this.
leneleven ratingone i bought 150000 coins 3 days ago and haven't received them yet !
lenfourteen ratingfive it will be even better if there are more science and types of traps!!!!
lenfifteen ratingone not working on samsung galaxy s 5.0, & i'm not the only one complaining about this.
lenfive ratingthree stops working at loading screen.
lenseventeen ratingfour it sometimes freezes and after it freezes i die because i dont know when it will unfreeze.
lentwentyfour ratingone when i open the  app all  it does is show me the company who made it then take me back to my home-screen.
lentwentyone ratingone whenever i get more than 1500 coins in my "bank" it'll delete them all so means i can't buy anything!
lennine ratingone i keep on getting glitches and force close signs.
lensix ratingone it takes ages to download aswell.
lenseventeen ratingthree itdoesnt deserve 5 stars because it lags and sometimes it wont even let you interact with the game.
lentwelve ratingone my character is always stuck on the right side of the screen..
lensixty ratingthree the only problems i'm having is when i'm playing it glitches and i'm stuck on level 8 because i have already gotten over 500,000 coins and it won't check it off...or shows i'm only half way there, which i assume i have to get a million coins which is another level up i have to do...
leneighteen ratingfour one down side is the sensitivity is kind of low, so it doesn't always register my moves.
lenseventeen ratingthree its a fun game but later objectives take too long to complete and the game gets boring
lenseven ratingone whenever i open the app it closes.
lenfive ratingone lags alot on my motorola droid2
leneighteen ratingfive the screen will come on, and makes these noises like its about to start and then force closes!
leneight ratingthree but it doesn't open it focres close
lenfourteen ratingone its stuck on the loading screen and after a minute it will automaticsaly close.
lenseven ratingone i don't like the revive system :(
lensix ratingone the file refuses 2 download 2 my tab.

lenfifteen ratingone wonder who thought doing a 27, 36 or 86 coin start in the 1st 250 meters was a good idea?
leneleven ratingfive the game is great but its always lagging on my droid 3.......
lenseven ratingtwo couldn't download on android 2.2  acer stream.
lensixteen ratingthree i've played before on another phone but i can not download it on my phone
lenten ratingfour the tilt feature is bad, especially in the narrow lanes...
lenthirteen ratingfour if u trip over then the big monkey covers almost 1/4th of the screen...
lennineteen ratingfour if u use a power up, n then u get the same before the first one is used up.
lenten ratingtwo it just keep on loading and then, it closes automatically.
lenseventytwo ratingfour if you're using an ability such as the coin magnet, and you run across another and pick it up before time runs out, the first game would renew the time remaining on the ability, but this game doesn't. it's worthless, and tends to punish you for getting upgrades that make your abilities last just long enough that it hadn't run out before you get to the next one.
lennine ratingfour coin magnet no longer gives you a con multiplier.
lentwentyone ratingfour though i have completed the objective of five lakh life time coins but it is not showing in   the completed objective
lentwenty ratingtwo i have upgraded head start for 1000 found less, but it is still asking 2000 coins for head start instead of 1500 coins
leneleven ratingfour awsm game but it takes too long to reach the destination!!!
lenseventeen ratingthree i completed gold miner but the meter is stuck at full and i am not leveling up.
lenthirteen ratingfour i have more than 500000 coins, but the objective gold miner is stilled locked.
lenfifteen ratingfour lags sometimes, and won't let me go back when im in the settings menu.
lensixteen ratingthree keeps on lagging everytime i run this app even if there is no other app running.
lenfifteen ratingone when i run the game and wait,it always turn back to my home page.....
lenfourteen ratingfour its good cozz its diffrentstuff but it frezzis i'll give it a 4 star
leneleven ratingone won't load past the first screen before self force closing.
lensix ratingtwo 500k objective its stuck at halfway bar.
lenfive ratingtwo power ups don't stack.
lentwelve ratingtwo lots of lag gets you killed constantly, even on lowest graphic setting.
leneighteen ratingthree the only problem i have is the game progress is lost if we attend any call while playing.
lenthirteen ratingfive this game doesn't work on lg 3d optimus i don't know why....
lenseventeen ratingfive the only thing wrong with it is that it keeps freezing but only on the odd ocation
leneleven ratingone lagging after update  once i play 3-4 games it starts to lag
leneight ratingfive this game isn't starting please fix it :)
lenfifteen ratingfour i hope ut does erase my entire stats with updates as it did last time....
lenfifteen ratingfour its all well and fine till level 8, but the 500,000 coins objective is not being updated.....
leneight ratingone great game but can't install on desire.
lentwelve ratingfour sumtimes images takes time 2 load while runing n d game dies there!!
lentwelve ratingone haven't had a chance to play as app crashes upon startup.
lensixteen ratingone can't play the ,when started it show the logo and take me to the homescreen
lentwentyfour ratingone i played this a couple of times and it was awsome but, on the sixth time i played this it turned onto the menu -___-
lentwenty ratingone i installed and un-installed and reinstalled this game 4 times and just crashes on the loading screen of temple run.
lensix ratingone it vibrates twice then crashes/closes.
lenten ratingone i have 500000 coins bt midas touch objective shows only 20% complete.
lentwenty ratingfive i like it, it just needs a place to jump off a edge to go on to a new trail.
lensixteen ratingthree since i updated, the game has become very lag and some time it even force close.
lennine ratingfive i got a glitches that made score 225,639,853 no lie
lenseventeen ratingfour its a great game but i find the tilt and screen controls not responsive enough to survive.
lentwentyfive ratingthree ok so this is wat happened i start to play nd then it froze and it kept doing it so someone needs to fix this!!!!
lentwenty ratingfive the only problem is it wont stop askin me to rate it so here u go now leave me alone
lentwentyfive ratingone game is good butt objectives are way to tough almost impossible to reach level 9 it's should b in achievements rather than in objectives bad..
lenfourteen ratingfive i am much above 500,000 coins, but the "gold miner" objective is not getting completed.
leneight ratingfive even 1,000,000 coins objective is stuck and not progressing
lennine ratingthree but i don't like that it keeps stopping
lenten ratingfour runs great on my s3 but sometime turns are un responsive
lentwentyone ratingfour love this game but when the boost runs out on the zip line i still run really fast with no protection.
lenthirtythree ratingtwo but today i started the app and the game was reset and i lost all my progress;i was on level 8 ,had a high score of 5,000,000+,multiplier 51 and i have lost it all.
lentwentysix ratingone i was so excited to download this game since the original was so good i thought this one would be better but it wont even open
lennine ratingone midas touch and the other latest objectives are ridiculous.
lensixteen ratingone just admit we beat the game or create new content instead of setting some inhuman goals.
lenten ratingone freezes on my phone everytime i try to play it.
lentwentyeight ratingtwo great graphics and all but somehow the number of coins i connect keep getting reset to 1500 or less asseta point so i cannot buy or upgrade my characters.
lenseven ratingfive its really fun but kills my battery.
lentwentyfive ratingfive but one thing i would really like to have in the next update are extra characters and pick up power ups stack on each other. :)
lentwelve ratingfour keeps with the style of the original with a new setting (china?).
lenthirty ratingfive although i do seem to have encountered an error trying to level up from lvl 8 (which is too hard btw!) it says to run a million points without power-ups.
lentwentyseven ratingfive i've done this several times now but the achievement stays locked, while it did work for a friend who has the exact same phone as me..
lenthirteen ratingthree sometimes it comes on and works great but other wise it wont start
leneight ratingone the game just freezes to a black screen.
lentwentytwo ratingfour only thing that sucks is that you have to go back to the beginning as opposed to starting where you left off.
lentwentynine ratingthree it was fine until it updated a few days ago after that it erased all my saved game and had to completely restart and it freezes up on me
leneight ratingthree a little of hang time in some transition.
lenfourteen ratingtwo game is very fun and addictive but is extremely laggy on my samsung stratosphere.
lentwenty ratingtwo takes a minute plus to load and in-game lag causes me to lose before i can get very far.
lenthirteen ratingfour better than the first buy it sometimes gets confusing with this level design.
lenthirteen ratingone on the last two obstacles and the total number of collected is frozen
lentwentytwo ratingone it always exits ive had it for a while and every time it exits before i can even play so im warning
lensixtyfour ratingthree i played temple run 2 on one of my friends ipad and i loved it and when i download it it wont let me play it just goes to tue little s looking thing then it vibrayes my phone and then takes me back to my home screen i have uninstalled it amd redone it and everything it wont work and i really wanna play :(
lenfortytwo ratingthree iv played this on other devices but i dont understand why it doesnt work on my phone it stays on the loading screen and after awhile it takes me out of the app please help and yes its compatible on my phone
lentwelve ratingfive never get bored, love it wish you could create your own characters.
lenfive ratingone keep crushing on htc desire :(
lenfifteen ratingone i downloaded the game and have never been able to get it to successfuly upload.
lenseven ratingfive cant get it downloded in my htc
lentwentythree ratingone i'll give it 5 stars if it would work for my lg thrill i never get past the picture before the start menu.
lentwentytwo ratingtwo this game was pretty fun at the beginning but after 15 minutes of playing it got really boring plus way to many ads.
lenseventeen ratingone i have obviously read in some rates and whenever i first open the app, it force closes.
lennineteen ratingfour i just bought 50,000 coins this weekend and they aren't on my game wtf come on man fix this
lentwentythree ratingfive only suggestion: make it so that if you get a second power up while you are already using one,  it is not ignored.
lensixteen ratingtwo game hangs if i press physical back button when re-incarnate with a gem option comes.
lentwentythree ratingtwo one of the objectives of lifetime 500,000 coins is stuck even though i have more than 600k. this happened after the same objective came twice.
lenten ratingthree it's fun but it always exits for no reason.
lenthirtynine ratingthree the double tap to use the power up when the bar gets full only works 1 out of 5 times  on the nexus 10 but on the siii the double tap to engage power up works perfectly fine, i don't understand.
lentwentytwo ratingone im a level 8 n the app wont open please fix with the next update i love this game but can't  it
lennineteen ratingfour the lag associated with the initial start of the game is annoying, but otherwise a great game all around.
lentwentythree ratingfour the only downside is that it is very repetitive  and the powerups are very dull,so at times the game os not fun.
lenfive ratingfour objectives not being updated accordingly
lensixtyone ratingtwo i love the graphics on this game but for some reason it doesn't keep count of how many coins i get/have it always says a lower number than what i started the run with dk if anybody else has this problem actually thinking bout deleting it becuz its irreating me too much not being able to get my upgrades
lentwentyone ratingthree it's annoying when it is down to the luck of level generation whether or not i get a good score.
leneleven ratingone the game is great but its always lagging on my droid 3.......
lentwentyfive ratingone now the problem is i can play the game once after that everytime i try to open the game it backs out 2 my home page.....
lentwentysix ratingthree in order for me to get to level 9 i had to beat an objective but i beat it and it wouldn't say i beat it
lennineteen ratingone the game will not let me play it on my galaxy s why it do that please fix it
lensix ratingfour yea wellllll it's kinda slow.
leneighteen ratingfour my only issue is that the 500,000 and 1,000,000 coin achievements are still bugged so i can't reach lvl 9!
lenten ratingthree the game is good but my coins keep getting deleted!!!!!!!!
lennine ratingone the app keeps crashing on my phone, need help.
lentwenty ratingfour a change in the scenery would be nice as running over the same old ground becomes rather boring after awhile.
lentwelve ratingone the app does not let me load the menu please fix this.
lenfifteen ratingone keeps getting stuck on the imangi studios screen and then returns to my home screen!
lenseventeen ratingfour the only things i would want are the power-ups to be able to stack and extend.
lenthirtyeight ratingfour example, picking up a coin magnet, and then picking up another one while the first one is going should extend the length if the power-up, but it does not, at least not the last 5 times i noticed.
lenthirtyfive ratingfour also, i kinda wish that the list of objectives was available, i've had to hit some of the million mark objectives 2 or 3 times because it wasn't active on the list of three objectives.
leneight ratingfour i did not get credit for collecting 500000 coins!
lenfour ratingfour the progress bar froze!
lentwelve ratingthree i hate the fact you can only see 3 objectives at a time.
lensixteen ratingthree in addition, i have a glitch that isn't giving me the 500,000 life time coins achievement.
lennineteen ratingthree lastly, i'm experiencing glitches where i'll jump and i then appear way off the map and die
lentwentyone ratingone i paid two times 99 cents each for 5 pack of gemstone n was charged but never got the gems in the game.
lentwentyone ratingfive i kind of don't like temple run  2 because it makes you do only three objectives so this is my opion
lennine ratingone takes soooo long to load didn't like it
lensix ratingthree 5 stars when there are more characters.
lenthree ratingfour more pick ups?
lentwentyfour ratingfour the only reason i gaveit 4 stars is because sometime when i am at a high score and going fast it will sometimes lag alittle.
lenfifteen ratingfour but it has too many details so that you can't focuse on the game.
leneleven ratingthree over 500k coins lifetime, but did not get credit for completing objective.
lenseventeen ratingone itdoesnt deserve 5 stars because it lags and sometimes it wont even let you interact with the game.
lentwenty ratingthree i was really enjoying this game until it updated and i lost everything. all my upgrades and coins and gems.
leneleven ratingtwo the whole game keeps crasshing it it keeps going upside down.
lenthirteen ratingtwo i had to re download it twice because it kept going upside down.
leneight ratingone the app won't launch keeps force closing
lensixteen ratingone i have been loving this game but with the newest update it won't even open.
lenseven ratingone just starts up then force closes itself.
lenten ratingtwo seems to lag a lot and causes me to die.
lenfourteen ratingtwo temple run 2 makes it hard to gt power-ups and that's not good
lenten ratingone this game won't even work after downloading just crashes!!
lenseven ratingfour need more charecters, more harder more everything
lenfifteen ratingthree i have a gs3 and i canf screen shot anything when i'm on the app
lenthirtythree ratingone so, i downloaded this, all excited, so i open it up and it goes to the little imagi studios picture, then it goes back to my home screen and that's it....help??
lentwentytwo ratingone i got a dimadond and i tried to use it but it said that i did not get one when trully did
lenten ratingfour but it lags like nobody's business on my phone.
lentwelve ratingfour sometimes to the point where i crash or die because of it.
lenseven ratingfive love it but it have lagss somtetimes
lentwenty ratingfive the only thing i would request would be like to see wehich level ur on and which levels are left.
lennineteen ratingfour i like it, but there is some lag that really annoys me and the startup is a bit long.
lenthirtythree ratingthree wtf man all my cions are gone it was many today but the next they its only 978 cions please fix in a new update and more characters please like the first temple run
lentwentysix ratingone it worked great til today, now it won't even load, this game just needs to be fixed to where it won't cut off randomly
leneighteen ratingone whenever my player jumps on to the next platform he falls through the ground alot of the times.
lenthirteen ratingthree i've heard it's a great game but i cant download it.
lentwentyone ratingtwo you should make temple run 2 patcher free again because i am not about to pay for something that was free before
lenthirteen ratingone everytime i click on it, it just redirect me to my home screen.
leneight ratingone i get first logo screen then it exits
lentwelve ratingfour cant stand phone lag running me into a tree, but otherwise fun.
lenfourteen ratingtwo needs fixing crashes on cart when in mine just loops then crashes ob galaxy s3
lensix ratingthree same tilting issues as everyone else.
lenfifteen ratingthree very cool glitch in the mine and then within a day, the whole game reset.
lenthirteen ratingthree downloaded update to see if that would get my stuf back, but no.
lentwentytwo ratingthree will write a longer review on my blog about the glitch in the mine but have to give it 3 stars for resetting.
lenten ratingone as soon as i get past the tutorial it freezes.
leneighteen ratingthree its fine for awhile but then it starts freezing up in the game and causes me to die.
lentwentyseven ratingfour i dont really like how you have to move your device over to one side almost all of the way to tilt other than that its cool
lenthirtythree ratingone so, i downloaded this, all excited, so i open it up and it goes to the little imagi studios picture, then it goes back to my home screen and that's it....help??
leneight ratingone i want it to be available on android 2.3.6!
lenten ratingone please update it and be abailable to lower android versions!
lenseventeen ratingthree for the mission earn 500000 lifetime coins,  i got over that but the mission wouldn't complete itself!  :(
leneight ratingfive the objective that needs 1000000 lifetime coins is stuck.
lenfourteen ratingone even after completing 500,000 lifetime coins, it's not completing my objective of completing it.
lennine ratingfive though downloading is slow bcz of big size application.
lenthirtythree ratingfour 1 which i'm sure a lot of people have but never noticed is that when you are on a one-wheeled turn in the tunnel, collected coins do not raise the power bar.
lenfifteen ratingfour 2 i am in the last 2 challenges and the 1,000,000 lifetime coins meter will not fill up.
leneleven ratingfour i have a little over 500,000 and the bar reads at about 200,000.
lentwelve ratingfour and 3 the collected power ups should overlap like in the first version.
lennine ratingfour good game, lags some when i first start playing. :)
lensix ratingfive tilt sense needs to be improved
lentwenty ratingone i look forward to play it but everytime i try to open it, it closes please fix that thank you
leneighteen ratingone nice graphics lalala but s*itty game play and constantly ramming into walls when switch left and right.
leneleven ratingone cannot play more than once then have to close from glitches
lenfifteen ratingfour nice game  over all only 4 stars, coins are lost if you don't use them
lenfifteen ratingfour the glitches are at a turn, it lags and even if i swipe, i fall.
lentwentysix ratingfour the second glitch is if i use the power up, then get the same ability, the ability ends at the same time as the power up.
lentwentyone ratingone the imangi studios screen launches but the game won't open - kicks me out to whatever screen i was on before.
lenten ratingfive love this game, but need to accumulate coins and gems!!!!
lensixteen ratingone it wont let me exit or even shut my phone off because it froze so bad.
lenfifteen ratingone also, i lost all of my progress in the game just by exiting the app.
leneleven ratingone it let's me download but it only loads them quits
lentwentyfive ratingone i purchased 150 gems online and i also got charged for it but i didnt get any gems even after two emails sent to these guys.
lenfourteen ratingfive this is a very good game but i wish you could get gems easier
lenten ratingone keeps on force closing fix it please.samsung galaxy s 4g
lensix ratingtwo very difficult to play & collect coins .
lentwentyseven ratingfive it does kind of make your phone hot aftr a while and that messes up tilting because i had zero tilt response when it was heating up.
lenfifteen ratingone sometimes it doesnt open and i have to delete it and redownload it to play
lenten ratingtwo each time i try to jump or slide it freezes
lenfifteen ratingfour i not able to complete 500,000 coin objective even though i have collected o er 550,000 coins.
lenthirtyone ratingthree i started out with 4352 coins and then played the game for a while and should have had 1048 coins more and it took my coins away now i only have 500 coins left!
lenten ratingfour i hv completed 100,00,000 coins objective but it still displays incomplete.
lenfourteen ratingfour works flawless on htc desire s but should have been a little more challenging.
leneighteen ratingone bit when i download it , it showdthe brick wall for about 45 secs and goes bck to my homepage!
lenseventeen ratingfour im already completed with the "gold miner" (500,000 lifetime coins) objective but it stays in my current objective. :(
lenthirtytwo ratingone my galaxy s2 hanging problem and incase application hang up time go task manager clear the temple run 2 game old score and all power ups its gone then open game new game running
lenfive ratingtwo it's giving error downloading .
lenfifteen ratingtwo also, when you get to level 8, eventually two of your goals become 5 and 10 million coins.
lenseven ratingthree lagging and freezing too much please fixed.
leneight ratingfour great game but sensitivity could have been better
lensix ratingfour fun and addicting but keeps freezing.
lennine ratingfour or my guy won't jump,duck please fix!
lensixteen ratingone i keep uninstalling and installing but it won't go past the imangi studios start screen.
lentwentyfour ratingthree and when you die after you reach a certain point that is were you should start to make the game abit easier to play.
lenfour ratingfour battery drains too fast.
lenten ratingfour the only problem is it some times freezes when playing
lensixteen ratingthree fun game, would get 5 if the game randomly lagging didn't result in me constantly losing
lenfive ratingone the game won't start
lenthirtytwo ratingone it will not let me attain powerups if i trip monkey will not follow up still havent comepleted tutorial because after each an ever game it freezes as soon as i die.
lenthirty ratingthree i love this game it is the best ever but every time i play it and i press "save me" i have no more gems and the game shuts down.
leneight ratingfour gathering coins dor upgrades is a little tedious.
lentwentythree ratingone the objectives progress bar for collecting 500,000 coins & running 10,000,000 distance don't increase even though my stats show that i have collected 700,000 lifetime coins!
lennine ratingfour if it stopped lagging a lot id give it 5
lentwentyfour ratingtwo the graphics r good but it takes a lot of the battery and it lost all the coins that i earned after it froze
lensixteen ratingone i loved this game but every time i try and open it up it wont open.
lenfifty ratingthree this game makes me feel like the developers looked at the first game, saw all of the "juddering" complaints and just decided to ignore them - this game is better than #1 but suffers from the same juddering and lack of response during the slow down, ir's good but not great
lenseven ratingone this wont run on my samsung infuse
lentwenty ratingone i use a samsung galaxy tab and every time i try to install this app it says 'error(498)' fix this?
lentwelve ratingone the update was so amazing, it deleted all my temple run 2 data.
lenthirtyseven ratingfour i had trouble swiping and tilting, it was too low for both also when in the mine shaft, when you make a turn, you have to be very fast to tilt the mine cart the other way.
lensix ratingfour just wish you could skip objectives.
lenthirtythree ratingone so my girlfriend wanted to play as the last chick so we bought the biggest coin pack over a day ago and never got any coins, uninstalling, any game that rips you off.
lenfourteen ratingfour would be better if the tilt was more responsive and the powerups renewed though.
lentwentyfour ratingone i had the game and enjoyed it for about a week and then lost my save and have to restart to 0/10 is my rating
lenseven ratingfour please develop more stages, tasks, and scenery.
lenten ratingfour the levels are the same and that's super boring!
lentwentyone ratingfour though i have completed the objective of five lakh life time coins but it is not showing in   the completed objective
lensixteen ratingtwo after level 8, you have to score 5 million coins to reach to next level which is boring
lentwentyone ratingtwo everytime i get up to 2000 coins all my coins reset and it makes me unable to buy new upgrades and people!
lenseventeen ratingone i have a samsung infuse and the game only shows the imangi studios screen before exiting game.
lenfortyone ratingone i went on today and it worked fine but i go on 10 minutes later and it starts me over from yhe tutorial and it cleared all my game history and i just got 3 million as my highscore yesterday, this game sucks!
lentwentyfour ratingone it wont let me open the app it worked till today please help it worked for a while now it stoped workin screw it
lenfifteen ratingthree the objective doesn't complete, if it is not shown currently on the level screen.
lentwentyseven ratingthree like for eg: if i've run 2,500m already, before it is shown as an objective in some level screen. it is still shown as incomplete objective.
lenseven ratingfour needs better graphics and sensitivity like temple run1. :-)
lennineteen ratingfive need to fix when you're on a  zipline and your speed boost ends you keep running fast forever
lenthirtytwo ratingfour will change to five if they fix bug as i have spent ages doing the objective to get 500,000 coins and now i have 500,100 coins and the bar is not even at half!
lenfourteen ratingthree all the upgrades i bought, all the coins and gems i collected were reset.
lenthirteen ratingthree and when i go into settings, and pressed back, it doesnt go back.
lentwentyone ratingthree when i play the game sometimes there are lagging times and ends up making me see different screens shots at once.
lenfive ratingthree needs lag fuxing update bad!
lennineteen ratingone it was working perfectly and i had so many things then randomly it reset me back to having nothing.
lennine ratingfour this app is really fun but its slow alot.
lentwentyseven ratingthree it's very disappointing that i lost 5500+ coins bec i unlocked all runners and left with 5500+, when i got back to the game, the balance coins shows 0.
lentwelve ratingthree also the coin counts used to reset to 0 when it reaches 2000 coins.
lenten ratingtwo its a good game but thr should b few level .
lenfifteen ratingfour 5 stars when you add tilt sensitivity, otherwise one of the most addicting games out there
lennine ratingfive random visual skips(pop ins) hurt game play sometimes.
lenthirteen ratingone whenever i try to open it it would go to the play store
leneleven ratingtwo everytime i click temple run it goes to my home screen
lenseventeen ratingfour just a little much sometimes, good graphics, feels like the swiping & tilting is a little behind sometimes.
lenthirtythree ratingfive so addictive but i have a kyocera hydro and i had to delete and reinstall because it would freeze now i have boo problems with it and i can not stay off it
leneight ratingthree it start off slow for as the movement.
lennine ratingthree keeps losing most of my coins - so cannot upgrade.
lenforty ratingfour this game is fun and addicting as hell but most of the time (and especially after i reach a few million points) it starts lagging like crazy and i end up dying because the game doesn't detect my swipe.
lenthirty ratingfive i'm not sure if it was meant to be this way, but the power meter doesn't fill up any faster when my coin value is doubled or tripled.
lentwentythree ratingfive it doesn't make any sense to me why the power meter would count the actual coin number, rather than the coin values.

lensixteen ratingone this application opens but after two minutes on the imangi studios screen it automatically shuts down.
leneleven ratingone it wont open when i download it i dont know why
lentwentythree ratingone then i appreciate the upgrades but the sensitivity is really bad and you guys didn't add the option to change it like tr1 .
lentwenty ratingone also there are times when swiping makes the character jump off the cliff or slide when i swipe to turn.
leneighteen ratingone it won't even open on my phone so i'm like what the heck what a waste.
lensixteen ratingthree the objective "collect 500,000 lifetime coins" doesn't work, i have the coins but no complete objective!
