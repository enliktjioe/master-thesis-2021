Control Mods are the worst things to come to multiplayer and Treyarch does nothing to implement the one playlist that is actually somewhat balanced and removes the ability to use them. Furthermore, I’d like to know why nothing has been addressed concerning multiplayer character outfit customization issues. It is completely unacceptable that people have purchased items wth real money that they can not use. I’m fairly certain refunds are in order.

       "719430  SDM, ABR, and the Swordfish are my top 3. I know that some people might not like the Swordfish, but it has crazy good accuracy and you can put a sniper rifle scope on it, which reminds me of the G11 with the sniper scope in Black Ops. But definitely take any assault rifle over any SMG, and make sure your weapons are different calibers. And the SG-12 is great for close encounters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

P2W tactics. and more scummy practices. all of which still continues to this day(also. you must spend money to earn that ingame currency, they don't give it to you for free). oh and by the way. epic games makes unreal engine. pretty sure they don't need the expinsive microtansactions, but here we are. Neat history lesson. You forgot the parts where the original game was pretty unpopular and heavily criticized for these decisions. In fact, most games with ridiculous \"special editions\", P2W mechanics, and other scummy tactics get criticized for it. &gt;in closing, you cant excuse fortnites system, which uses two fronts of full on microtransactions. save the world with their special editions, 100$ microtransactions, microtransactions to progress you, materials. OH AND ITS A RNG LOOTBOX SYSTEM. and battle royal which has paid challenges, 20$ skins, a copy and pasted design. and has expensive emotes. Most people, when bringing up Fortnite nowadays, are referring to the free to play BR mode that made it popular in the first place. The free BR mode is where the Battlepass comparisons lie. The free BR mode of Fortnite generally receives little criticism for its monetization practices, even praise compared to what other games will do. You can try to cherry pick the negatives from what's essentially a separate, failed game (The STW Fortnite) at this point to support your narrative...but really, all you're doing is adding fuel to the fire. The shit that's scummy that the original Fortnite did is stuff gamers almost universally hate...and some of those scummy practices have made their way into BLOPS4, hence the criticism and disapproval.</td>\n",

       "384968  several things here, why the hell did treyarch remove the one hit melee with the knife and made it so you had to put it in your loadout? Also you shouldnt be able to die after the match has ended AND why does it say \"loss stat prevented\" when you won? This game continues to amaze me in how broken it truly is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

The crazy part is that I'll be connected to the same server three games in a row and get different results each game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "294292  Hmm, good point. I guess I never thought of it that way. It is a somewhat bland reward for easter egg hunters. And I assume since most casual players don't care for the easter egg, they would never unlock the casual map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "667350  I get that not being able to play the game for the first two weeks after release is bad(I was \"lucky\" and didn't experience that as I bought the game later), but that's not what this thread is about.

       "670060  > you forget that fortnite started out as a game with several editions, 60-150$. combined with a 100$ microtransaction. P2W tactics. and more scummy practices. all of which still continues to this day(also. you must spend money to earn that ingame currency, they don't give it to you for free). oh and by the way. epic games makes unreal engine. pretty sure they don't need the expinsive microtansactions, but here we are. Neat history lesson. You forgot the parts where the original game was pretty unpopular and heavily criticized for these decisions. In fact, most games with ridiculous \"special editions\", P2W mechanics, and other scummy tactics get criticized for it. >in closing, you cant excuse fortnites system, which uses two fronts of full on microtransactions. save the world with their special editions, 100$ microtransactions, microtransactions to progress you, materials. OH AND ITS A RNG LOOTBOX SYSTEM. and battle royal which has paid challenges, 20$ skins, a copy and pasted design. and has expensive emotes. Most people, when bringing up Fortnite nowadays, are referring to the free to play BR mode that made it popular in the first place. The free BR mode is where the Battlepass comparisons lie. The free BR mode of Fortnite generally receives little criticism for its monetization practices, even praise compared to what other games will do. You can try to cherry pick the negatives from what's essentially a separate, failed game (The STW Fortnite) at this point to support your narrative...but really, all you're doing is adding fuel to the fire. The shit that's scummy that the original Fortnite did is stuff gamers almost universally hate...and some of those scummy practices have made their way into BLOPS4, hence the criticism and disapproval.   \n",

       "411113  Ridiculous that over 2 months after release there is still no league play in by far the most unbalanced MP experience. Control Mods are the worst things to come to multiplayer and Treyarch does nothing to implement the one playlist that is actually somewhat balanced and removes the ability to use them. Furthermore, I’d like to know why nothing has been addressed concerning multiplayer character outfit customization issues. It is completely unacceptable that people have purchased items wth real money that they can not use. I’m fairly certain refunds are in order. Countless players have reported their character outfit reverting to default every time a lobby is joined.   \n",

       "8404    I don't get how everyone is complaining about the combat knife, it works perfectly fine (at least for me); and I always end up being the top 3 in the lobby when I use it. IMO the lunge is stronger than it should be. Also, I've never had any issues killing someone when a lunge does not register and does an slice, except in really rare occasions. IMO it is only outclassed by a weapon melee, since they can still shoot at you then 145dmg melee you to death. That's the only bad thing about using it, and it's not the knife's fault.

What annoys me is the way Activision is just trying to constantly shove this crap down our throats. Or that a full-price game with a very expensive season pass has more microtransactions than most F2P games out there. Plus there was outrage about the pass before the game launched and apparently sales of said pass have not been very good. So what does Activision do to try and appease gamers? Nothing. Instead they add even more and overly aggressive MTX to the game in order to make up for lost revenue. I understand publishers put out these games in order to turn a profit, but the way Activision goes about it is so greasy. And when sales are down they make it even worse. All of that is what is turning me off of Black Ops 4 to be honest. But hey, if you want a bunny suit I'm not going to try and stop you. Just remember why it's in the game in the first place.</td>\n",

If you played that much in WW2 you'd have the challenge done in LESS THAN A WEEK. 10 mins maximum per match, 4 hours is 24 matches. You can speed it up by playing faster gamemodes. Think of it this way, if BO4's time based system was measured in matches, it would be over 600 matches for First Strike, and 300 matches for Absolute Zero. No doubt about it, this system is worse. Not to mention that everything in First Strike was garbage filler apart from 2, maybe 3 items.

The microtransactions are purely out of greed at this point since I think I read that Activision made $4 billion last year on MTX alone. And I’m fine with that, but I think that they could make billions of dollars on MTX if they just kept creating a lot of personalization packs like OP mentioned for $2 or $4 and also have a $50 season pass. But with these RNG crates I feel that there’s really no need to have paid DLC multiplayer maps if they can make so much off game sales alone. I mean look at RDR2, it currently doesn’t have MTX and still grossed $750 million in it’s first 3 days. Granted RDR2 has been heavily anticipated for the last 8 years but CoD still manages to generate a lot of hype that translates to sales each and every year. I have no issue with microtransactions as long as they are done right, I understand that these games get more and more expensive each year and that further monetization is necessary to keep their profit margins up but I just think they can have more consumer-friendly ways of doing it.</td>\n",

The damage for the laser gun in AW was tied to framerate, so if you got over 60fps it would almost triple it's DPS and you could melt guys in a quarter second, I believe BO3 had a similar issue. Aiming was always weird and jumpy since that too was tied to FPS and had aim acceleration that could never be turned off, frame skipping was awful, and overall just a mess. Don't even get me started on crashes, stability, and the fact that the games essentially had ZERO anticheat whatsoever. To this day if you can even find anyone playing multiplayer AW/BO3/IW/MWR/WW2 on PC (since the player counts dropped to double/low triple digits a month after launch usually) at least half of them will be using ESP, walls and aimbots. There's a lot of legitimate complaints about the current state of BO4 on PC but compared to what we had to deal with leading up to WW2 it's an absolute dream come true. I can get 120+fps 90% of the time on my 1070 with a great motherboard and 16gb RAM, at least on my end I have only experienced a Connection Interrupted issue once and that was almost a month ago. I had a stuttering issue in Blackout a handful of weeks ago and after just logging off for a few hours I never experienced it again. I hate using the term \"vocal minority\" but it really is what a lot of those posts end up being. Obviously there are issues, but a lot of them are subjective. I don't subscribe to this sub and only check it manually maybe once a day or so because I don't really have any issues with the game at all aside from the MTX being shitty and matchmaking a bit of a bust. Oftentimes people making a stink about performance turn out to be running on a severely underpowered rig, live in an area with very low populations of players, or have a sub optimal internet connection and it's easy to just put all the blame on the devs. Millions of others are having next to no issues with the game and have been happily playing.</td>\n",

Do you know why adblock and cord-cutting/conversion to streaming is so fucking attractive for web browsing/shows? Turns out lots of people hate adverts/upselling bits in their entertainment, especially if they've already paid for it. If there was an option to turn this shit off and not have to see it, period, I wouldn't care if they added it in, but by making it a part of the experience it's essentially a psychological attack on the consumer to get them to spend more money. Some people have more resistance to that than others. I don't intend to spend any money, but it's pretty fucking annoying when an MTX system's notifications pop up every match. I didn't spend money to be bitched at to spend more, especially when the product is ALREADY asking for another $50 in the form of a season pass for future content despite having an MTX system built in. I won't bitch about a company making money IF they fucking earned it...I will bitch about a company being greedy in the laziest way possible. If the season pass didn't exist and future maps were paid for via the MTX, I wouldn't be irate.

On one hand, we have those who want things to change and not have any MTX in games at all - earn everything offered through playing the game. For this to work, MTX has to not be profitable (or on the small chance, be outlawed/banned) for businesses to stop using it in games. So, when someone buys into MTX, it's kind of like a little loss for the fight against MTX. On the other hand, though, there are people who, like you, want to spend their expendable income on things they enjoy - this includes buying new, cool things in the game they enjoy (CoD, in this case). That's perfectly fine, too, because why not? It's your hard earned money and you should spend it how you see fit! Neither is wrong, but they are both on opposing sides of this issue - that's why it's seen as a bad thing to buy into MTX while, at the same time, it is perfectly ok to do so :-/</td>\n",

If you look at all the problems with BO4, none are related to microtransactions not working how they want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "90077   \\#BoycottActivision. Activision’s monetization of these already paid games has gone too far. Unique weapons and gameplay-affecting content constrained to tier progressions or loot crates that can be bought outright for an advantage is unacceptable in a $60 game.

       "606280  They don't bother me in that I don't care what other players have or what they want to spend their money on. What annoys me is the way Activision is just trying to constantly shove this crap down our throats. Or that a full-price game with a very expensive season pass has more microtransactions than most F2P games out there. Plus there was outrage about the pass before the game launched and apparently sales of said pass have not been very good. So what does Activision do to try and appease gamers? Nothing. Instead they add even more and overly aggressive MTX to the game in order to make up for lost revenue. I understand publishers put out these games in order to turn a profit, but the way Activision goes about it is so greasy. And when sales are down they make it even worse. All of that is what is turning me off of Black Ops 4 to be honest. But hey, if you want a bunny suit I'm not going to try and stop you. Just remember why it's in the game in the first place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "209113  No. A fully priced game with an expensive season pass should not need for lootboxes. And the fact that the implementation of the tier system is worse the Fortnite and the specialist skins are the shittiest excuse for character customisation I’ve ever seen is embarrassing. We should not have to choose between two evils, especially when people are paying $110 for an unpolished game. Ofc I see that large corporations such as Activision or EA will never give up MTX. So why not just do what BFV is doing and keep MTX to only skins that can be directly purchased, and no other BS. And also put a shred of effort into the specialist skins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "12433   Obviously its only business but to market a game as competitive and then to lock things like talismans behind huge paywalls is ridiculous! I dont think they should remove MTX all together because theres absolutely no way in hell they ever will, it just doesnt make sense.

       "348829  No. Stop defending a billion dollar company for cheaping out on their consumers. They already take advantage of us with their F2P MTX system (and blackops pass), but I guess it's too much to ask for a decent server tick rate. 60 hz is the minimum, end off. Worse part is, the very same consumers dont want something WHICH ACTUALLY IMPROVES THEIR GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE. Honestly the people in the sub-reddit should be in r/submissive.

       "633071  To go even further...we had way more customization options in BO3 that were unlock-able through challenges. My issue with this whole MTX thing is they keep stripping aspects of the game that used to be free and are locking them behind a paywall. People that continue to accept MTX are part of the problem, so year after year we end up with a more stripped out game. Even the BO4 as a whole feels half assed compared to BO3. The same thing happened in Destiny 2 and definitely caused an uproar, I don't get how Activision doesn't expect the same reaction here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

My main problem atm is the fucking cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "223166  And if enough people ignore it and don’t interact with it that’s a more direct way to force change. Crying on forums lets a community manager know there’s a problem, it lets a dev team know there’s a problem. Can they do shit about though? It’s an uphill battle for both sides to bring change. Loss of revenue forces the hand of the money men on top. Don’t buy anything and eventually they have to come up with a scheme that’s attractive to consumers. There will never be no micro transactions. Give that up, the but I paid $60 argument is a hill you are dying on. But eventually they have to reach a middle ground with fair mtx pricing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "29985   Yeah, I just hope the moderators don’t find this to be somehow irrelevant. The whole modern system for MTXs needs to be uprooted and replaced with this one. Edit: It’s pretty clear to me that the whole message of this post has been skewed. I’m not looking for the *same exact camouflages* in a new CoD. I’m looking for the old MTX system itself to return. Camouflages listed in pages like this was more than far enough, and it made for a happy community.

       "132430  But WW2 had daily challenges and contracts that got you great gear. Why grind out 4 hours of playtime a day when a skilled player can get all the challenges done in a few matches? BO4 is leagues worse than any MTX system we've had before. Sure, 150 matches every few months was a grind, but BO4 expected 200 tiers of grinding in the first 50 days. If you played that much in WW2 you'd have the challenge done in LESS THAN A WEEK. 10 mins maximum per match, 4 hours is 24 matches. You can speed it up by playing faster gamemodes. Think of it this way, if BO4's time based system was measured in matches, it would be over 600 matches for First Strike, and 300 matches for Absolute Zero. No doubt about it, this system is worse. Not to mention that everything in First Strike was garbage filler apart from 2, maybe 3 items. WW2 had tons of great new variants, uniforms and some new weapons in its first event, BO4 had literally 4 variants and not a single uniform that isn't a recolour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "122758  He didn't really say anything of substance besides the fact that Microtransactions are designed to be like gambling, which was already pretty well known. For profit companies are going to try to make profit. But personally I don't care about the MTX in this game, I find them a lot less intrusive than Bo3. In MP it's all cosmetic, and in Zombies the paid ones are a lot less OP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "18242   Yeah I get that they need to make a return on their investment but BO4 grossed $500 million in 3 days. And much more on game sales alone by now I imagine. The microtransactions are purely out of greed at this point since I think I read that Activision made $4 billion last year on MTX alone. And I’m fine with that, but I think that they could make billions of dollars on MTX if they just kept creating a lot of personalization packs like OP mentioned for $2 or $4 and also have a $50 season pass. But with these RNG crates I feel that there’s really no need to have paid DLC multiplayer maps if they can make so much off game sales alone. I mean look at RDR2, it currently doesn’t have MTX and still grossed $750 million in it’s first 3 days. Granted RDR2 has been heavily anticipated for the last 8 years but CoD still manages to generate a lot of hype that translates to sales each and every year. I have no issue with microtransactions as long as they are done right, I understand that these games get more and more expensive each year and that further monetization is necessary to keep their profit margins up but I just think they can have more consumer-friendly ways of doing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "350992  It definitely has to do with Activision also but you’re right the developers have a say and no one understands this. They are all so quick to say “oh IW was hated that’s why it had a good system” but they don’t realize that the mtx is decided pretty early on since they have to make the mechanics and shit like that for it.

       "294607  You reiterated yourself throught the whole comment. It was all one subject essentially. Yes, it's a traditional CoD experience because of the base features. Cosmetic MTX is optional bonus content. The Black Market progression is side content. Again, I've been focusing on actual gameplay progression mechanics and have not once put any thought or effort into the Black Market. It in NO WAY dictates how much fun you have in the game. There are many things aside from the Black Market that should keep players coming back. You can't get 100 headshots quickly. You can't get 500 kills with a certain attachment quickly. Your comment is really hard to reply to entirely because like I said it's a lot of redundent stuff AND it all is blatantly untrue. If a player thinks the Black Market is the only way to progress or unlock things then they really shouldn't be playing the game in the first place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "396655  I disagree with you. First I think this game is actually very good. Second I think that mtx are not being forced or shoved down anyone’s throats(they are cosmetic only and do not affect game play in any way and they are really bad) When this community should care about mtx is when the actual game dev time suffers from them (updates stop, there’s a fuckload of different mtx all really quickly).

       "759373  Elixirs/Tailsmen/GGs are MTX BS that they want people to buy, so they weren't in there since it started only recent when they decided a full priced game with DLC needs F2P game BS. Now that that is out of the way. Shield, it started in BO 2 with origins so, no it wasn't from the start. Perks, every game has added or removed perks, and as it stands the only perk we currently have from when it started is QR unless you count the \"free\" speed cola thing after buying all 4 perks. Guns, each game has new and different guns. Power Ups I'll give you. EE design has changed. Jimmy's EEs were not as samey as Blundy's EEs. Like if you just listed steps down, with Blundy's EEs you probably couldn't tell what map they are for if you just listed the steps down on paper unless you were a zombies fan. Special weapons new ones get added every so often or old ones get changed into new ones. Grenades I'll give you. Zombies isn't the same as when it started, it has gotten tired and they aren't trying anything new or exciting, it's why BO 4 zombies is easily the 2nd worst in terms of fun of all CoD zombie iterations. It's not WW2 bad, but it's damn close.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "944594  The community isn’t largely negative about it. Only the vocal community is and that makes up about 1%-5% of all players. I guarantee they have already made millions off of mtx this year. That’s why the set the prices this way. People buy it. Also I never said people wanting it to be cheaper were in the wrong but the ones who feel they are entitled to it being cheaper that were. They are the greedy ones. Yes they paid $60-$100 for the game and they got exactly what they paid for. Expecting more to be included in that price that clearly is not is nothing more that greed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I don’t think he’ll have a problem with people buying MW4 that game will be hugely hyped up.

       "54794   A lot of people are forgetting that previous Call of Duty PC ports had been nearly unplayable unless you had a supercomputer available to you. Even then on top of the line hardware matches in Advanced and Infinite Warfare would struggle to keep a consistent 1080p 60FPS, and even THEN most weapons and mechanics were tied directly to framerate. The damage for the laser gun in AW was tied to framerate, so if you got over 60fps it would almost triple it's DPS and you could melt guys in a quarter second, I believe BO3 had a similar issue. Aiming was always weird and jumpy since that too was tied to FPS and had aim acceleration that could never be turned off, frame skipping was awful, and overall just a mess. Don't even get me started on crashes, stability, and the fact that the games essentially had ZERO anticheat whatsoever. To this day if you can even find anyone playing multiplayer AW/BO3/IW/MWR/WW2 on PC (since the player counts dropped to double/low triple digits a month after launch usually) at least half of them will be using ESP, walls and aimbots. There's a lot of legitimate complaints about the current state of BO4 on PC but compared to what we had to deal with leading up to WW2 it's an absolute dream come true. I can get 120+fps 90% of the time on my 1070 with a great motherboard and 16gb RAM, at least on my end I have only experienced a Connection Interrupted issue once and that was almost a month ago. I had a stuttering issue in Blackout a handful of weeks ago and after just logging off for a few hours I never experienced it again. I hate using the term \"vocal minority\" but it really is what a lot of those posts end up being. Obviously there are issues, but a lot of them are subjective. I don't subscribe to this sub and only check it manually maybe once a day or so because I don't really have any issues with the game at all aside from the MTX being shitty and matchmaking a bit of a bust. Oftentimes people making a stink about performance turn out to be running on a severely underpowered rig, live in an area with very low populations of players, or have a sub optimal internet connection and it's easy to just put all the blame on the devs. Millions of others are having next to no issues with the game and have been happily playing.   \n",

       "82753   And I can't understand why it's so hard to grasp that the people complaining aren't the ones buying the MTX shit, or why someone might not want an upselling mechanic built into their entertainment experience. Do you know why adblock and cord-cutting/conversion to streaming is so fucking attractive for web browsing/shows? Turns out lots of people hate adverts/upselling bits in their entertainment, especially if they've already paid for it. If there was an option to turn this shit off and not have to see it, period, I wouldn't care if they added it in, but by making it a part of the experience it's essentially a psychological attack on the consumer to get them to spend more money. Some people have more resistance to that than others. I don't intend to spend any money, but it's pretty fucking annoying when an MTX system's notifications pop up every match. I didn't spend money to be bitched at to spend more, especially when the product is ALREADY asking for another $50 in the form of a season pass for future content despite having an MTX system built in. I won't bitch about a company making money IF they fucking earned it...I will bitch about a company being greedy in the laziest way possible. If the season pass didn't exist and future maps were paid for via the MTX, I wouldn't be irate. That would give justification to its existence beyond shameless milking of the lowest common denominator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "297017  The fact of the matter is, both of you are right and that's what sucks about it. On one hand, we have those who want things to change and not have any MTX in games at all - earn everything offered through playing the game. For this to work, MTX has to not be profitable (or on the small chance, be outlawed/banned) for businesses to stop using it in games. So, when someone buys into MTX, it's kind of like a little loss for the fight against MTX. On the other hand, though, there are people who, like you, want to spend their expendable income on things they enjoy - this includes buying new, cool things in the game they enjoy (CoD, in this case). That's perfectly fine, too, because why not? It's your hard earned money and you should spend it how you see fit! Neither is wrong, but they are both on opposing sides of this issue - that's why it's seen as a bad thing to buy into MTX while, at the same time, it is perfectly ok to do so :-/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Developers have gone to great lengths to profile and study how to attract the biggest whales, and again, your pittance a month pales in comparison to the guy who sees a new gun at the end of the contraband system and buys out all the tiers on day 1 - except this time reserves come after T100 so they’re encouraged to spend more to get whatever’s in the latter boxes, and if they’re going to drop 100 dollars on a gun and skins; they’ll happily drop another 100, 200, 500 more to exhaust the contraband stream and buy up special orders/blackjack rotations Why do you think triple A developers try to mimic gatcha game systems so closely? I mean fuck there’s like maybe two ethical F2P games I can think off and I still know and have seen people spend upwards of 30,000 a month alone on fucking warframe or CS:GO skins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "298435  I'm with you on this. Personally, I really don't care about the recent drama in regards to the MTX system as it's all cosmetic stuff and I don't buy COD points. But if they start doing the same with new guns or p2win stuff then that is when things will become a lot more serious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "315431  I think crossplay would be a great way to sustain the Zombies playerbase. Especially for PC, I’ve read many comments (like this post) on how finding a lobby during non-peak hours is tough. Although Sony would be the holdout if history is any indication. I think Activision would go for it: in their mind you can play with more of your friends and you all can flex your cosmetic items then wanna buy more (idc personally for MTX but the whales will be whales).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "582124  So tired of this argument.... No... shit. People don't complain this much about mtx. People complain about a shitty mtx. Especially in a paid game. Make special costumes like fortnite has, make them paid only. Have the tier system separate but obtainable by minimum 1 hour a day because look even a hardcore gamer has responsibilities throughout the week. 1-2 hours a day is a lot of time a day if you have other obligations. It's why Fortnites system is so popular. It's done right, I hate mtx but I can totally understand fornite model and it's a friendly model that even rewards vbucks. It's a free game. This is a paid one with a worse system.
