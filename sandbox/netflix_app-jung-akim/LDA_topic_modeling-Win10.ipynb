I used to be a netflix DVD, and then blue-ray, but had two kids and it became an expense that wasn't worth it (we'd kept a movie for 30 days, never watched it, and sent it back).  I wasn't sure how well it would work this go around with just the streaming service, but so far the whole family has enjoyed it.  The streaming service has improved a lot since 3 years ago when I cancelled the DVD/streaming.  So far the service has been positive and I'm leaning heavily on reup'ing when the free trial ends.<br /><br />This has probably been said a hundred times over, so I'll bullet the features that are great:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Multi-platform support: iPhone, Android, Kindle, PS3, Wii - and the kids (both under 5) can operate them all but the PS3<br />- Kid only section - the kids don't need to sift through the adult stuff to find their own interests (younger kids)<br />- Low buffering even with HD movies on a slower internet connection speed (Time Warners $40 month solo plan)<br />- 3 different throttling options for network speed issues and data plans with smaller allotments<br />- Simultaneous use on multiple platforms - one kid watches one thing on one device, wife and I on another, other kid on another device<br />- Decent selection of TV shows - lots of good kids programing from Disney, Nick, Cartoon Network, HUB (kids really like the superhero shows - would be an extra $6 with DirecTV to get these monthly, and I'd have to worry about configuring DVR (not hard, but videos corrupt over time), and deal with commercial breaks and then shows starting up for a min that then end.  Granted that setting can be changed for some programing, but it then cuts off the end of the show.<br />- Movie selection is good for Parents that haven't seen some movies and don't want to try and rent through, or want to catch up on some shows that aren't on anymore<br />- The venture into new content solely available on netflix is an interesting concept, will be nice to see where it goes<br /><br />Cons - not too many yet but...<br />- Movies are older, about what you'd expect to see as filler with HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, etc., but not a lot of new stuff on the streaming.<br />- noticeable strain on ISP network speed - but that was to be expected, especially with HD, but kinda of a bummer when trying to stay with lower tiered network plans (but that's more of an infrastructure issue with the US and ISPs than Netflix) - however the throttling options to help that.<br />- shows drop off - over time, things fall off the streaming availability, but I guess with licensing fees and storage constraints they can't stay up forever...  Would be nice if there was a feature to allow you to request an older show that would let you live stream but store instead for a day or two - I'd be willing to pay extra money for that ($2-$3 extra a month perhaps?)</td>\n",

Netflix, or the Android Netflix app, I don't know which, is pretty much the minimum one might expect from streaming video. If all you want to do is watch a movie or TV show continuously, or with a few pauses and resumes, then it does okay. A TIVO this is not and I find that simple things such as rewinding and playing back a challenge the app just is not up to.<br /><br />At least, this has been my experience. Here is a list of some issues I have met:<br /><br />1. The app does not respond to the pause and resume buttons on my Android G-Box remote. I have to use their on-screen stuff.<br />2. The app almost always stalls a few seconds into streaming and I have to click on the red button in the progress bar in order to resume. It might go on its own if I were to give it enough time. I am not patient enough with it..<br />3. When I pause, I have to click on the pause icon; as I said, the remote is not recognized. Almost always, the app will not resume clicking the play icon. I have to use the escape key to get out of the video and then renter it.<br />4. The video is pixilated when it first starts to run. I assume that is to stream lower quality video until it has pumped out enough to get going reliably. As you can see from above, it has trouble even doing that.<br />5. Clicking on the replay icon takes you back so short a distance as to be virtually worthless. There is a mental delay from the time you think you want to rewind, and then the time it takes to get the keyboard out and do it; that time is longer than tha time Netflix goes back. When I click the icon several times, I often lose the stream or it can go WAY back erratically.<br />6. Fast forward? Forget about it. You can shift the video forward by manipulating the slider bar image but it is hit and miss because you don't have any time info on the screen, so you have to guess where you might want to be. I have to do that to the end of the show if I want to fool Netflix into believing that I have watched the show.<br />7. Some things such as changing lists need to be set on Netflix on your computer, rather than through the G-Box on the TV screen.<br /><br />It surprises me that Netflix seems to have such a clunky, kludgey interface. Netflix has been around since the late 1990s but the G-Box is much more recent. Computers don't usually have remote controls, nor do phones. Perhaps this is partly why Netflix is remote challenged.<br /><br />My G-Box came with a Netflix app installed, but one day Netflix crashed and would no longer open. I downloaded this app and upgraded the old app. That didn't fix the problem. A call to Netflix eventually led to my solution which was to flush the caches on the app. This app has the same functionality, and disfunctionality, of the original app had.<br /><br />I had read the reviews on this app and I frankly wonder what planet some of the gushy and gooey reviews are from. My experience is different. Perhaps I am a victim of expectations. I have Dish and its TIVO-like pause. rewind, and fast forward work like a dream. Netflix is Cro-Magnon in this respect.<br /><br />There are benefits to Netflix. It usually streams more reliably that 1 Channel or Ice on the XBMC app on the box. On the other side, Netflix has limited content and is usually at least a year behind on TV shows currently running. It must be licensing issues for the TV shows.<br /><br />I like old movies and this is not a forte of Netflix. Movies are spotty. Don't expect to find Casablanca, Cabaret, or The Maltese Falcon on Netflix. I find four, count them four, John Wayne movies on Netflix. Classic Sci-Fi? Unlikely. Downton Abbey? No, Amazon has that. (Amazon does not have an Android app yet for its Prime Instant Video movies, alas.) Netflix focuses on the current and that liked by today's (juvenile) tastes.<br /><br />Netflix has made a recent profit of $8M. What is it doing with its money? Is it making Netflix better? Is it making its Android app any better? I would hope so.<br/><br />Hmm, maybe I'll check out Hulu?<br /><br />Update: I forgot about subtitles. We often use subtitles because many actors mumble and swallow their words, especially at the punch line, some show's music drowns out dialog, and we watch some British stuff (\\\\\"Sherlock\\\\\" and \\\\\"Doc Martin\\\\\", for example) that is often audibly challenged to my American ear. Netflix's subtitles proceed the actual spoken words, sometimes by several seconds. If there is to be a lag, I would prefer if the subtitle followed. That way, if I don't understand something I can keep an eye out for it to come up in a second. Netflix's way is perverse.<br /><br />Netflix's subtitles on my G-Box are yellow upper and lower case on a transparent background. This makes them difficult to read, especially on a brighter image. As with most of Android Land, documentation is scarce so I do not know if I have choices available for subtitles on Netflix. (Update this update: I did find a way to modify subtitle settings on my computer and logged into my account. Now I have small caps in white on a black background. Now if I could solve the sync thing...)<br /><br />The sorry documentation is a general lament for Android apps. It seems that using Android is a never ending parade of Easter Egg opportunities; that is, fining out hidden and obscure surprises built in by the programmers for those who are not old enough for the term \\\\\"easter Egg\\\\\". This of clever Android programmers coming up with all sorts of goodies but failing to let us in on them. If we are lucky, we stumble on them from time to time.<br /><br />Netfix support can be a little Nitwitflix at times. I called early on to see how I could scroll a window and I got several bat $^!# crazy answers, none of which were at all correct. Eventually I found out by accident to hold down the left mouse key and drag the window, one direction or the other, I forget which.<br /><br />All together, the Netflix app appears to be a dull knife of the cutting edge./><br />Hmm, maybe I'll check out Hulu?<br /><br />Update: I forgot about subtitles.

The latest app update is the worst yet. I like watching the intros and credits of my shows and movies, but now the app skips the TV show intros and always minimizes the show or movie when the credits roll. Often the minimizing happens while the show is still playing!!!! This is extremely irritating. To top it all off, Netflix no longer allows user feedback on its Facebook page. I desperately wish Netflix had more competition, because I would have left years ago. Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus are good, but unfortunately Netflix is still the industry leader. Overall the service is valuable, but the user experience is terrible and continues to get worse regularly. I've had Netflix for years, but I hate it more and more everyday.</td>\n",

Most of the time it will load the video, but then we just get a black screen with sound. Since the Fire lacks a task manager there and basic menu access for each app, there is no way to force close the app and restart it. I think this is a fundamental design flaw in the Fire, that it is difficult to close/exit an app and restart it. Netflix needs to issue an update.</td>\n",

It would be better if you could use it without Internet. Sometimes it takes a long to to load or buffer an it makes you shows blurry. There is not as much movies and shows that some other thing like netflix have. Netflix is very good app for sitting down with you family and watching a movie or being alone and watching a show or movie on the couch or even in your bed. Netflix has a lot of great movies and shows to watch. If you find one that you like but you don't want to watch it the you can add it to your list. Overall netflix is really great app and if<br /> you like to watch movies then I would get this app for sure. I like the fact that it is free so for sure get it.I guess you can pay more money monthly for netflix to work on more than two devices at a time. Overall other than the long load times that we encounter once in a great while we will continue to be a netflix customer. We have been now for 4 years and it runs great on out kindles,laptops,and I pods. You can also use it where they have free WiFi like mcdonalds.</td>\n",

The &#34;team&#34; also apparently believes giving people fewer options is better because it's all just too advanced for us sheep to understand.  I now have to scroll more, hit the back button more, use the navigation ring on Fire TV remote more, and I don't enjoy Netflix as much as I used to.  Eventually there will be increasing options outside of Netflix and that will be a good thing.  I'm thinking maybe I should try Amazon Prime. Although Amazon is getting arrogant too, at least the Prime service lets the movie play to the end without shrinking the credits into oblivion.

Interface is fluid and easy to navigate. Content is good. Content used to be great but there doesn't seem to be as many new releases(good new releases that is) and blockbusters as in the past but there is still a lot of offerings. When you think Netflix most people think movies but Netflix has tons of good shows. Complete collections of old and new t.v. shows. Lots of documentaries(but not enough serious science or political ones in my opinion). Plenty of cartoons and other kids shows. Some anime shows and movies. One thing I don't like is how they recommend shows to you based on what you watched previously. &#34;Because you watched Shrek&#34; and then it'll show you one related movie and twenty unrelated movies. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't take up appx.50% of its interface. Its not bad just mostly inaccurate in my opinion. Also I would like to be able to search/browse by genre. In the main interface it lists movies under genre but you can't browse every movie or show under that genre.These are very minor issues and more like pet peeves than actual issues. There's a lot of B-movies(which I like) and then there are movies that are so bad they shouldn't exist but you are forced to navigate through them to find something good to watch. I'd like would like if I didn't have dig through these worse than B-movies. Overall Netflix is the best streaming service of its kind and if they would start offering just a few more blockbusters or above 3 star new releases a month then I give it 5 stars.</td>\n",
