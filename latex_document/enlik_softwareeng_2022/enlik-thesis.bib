    abstract = {With the popularity of smartphones and mobile devices, mobile application (a.k.a. “app”) markets have been growing exponentially in terms of number of users and downloads. App developers spend considerable effort on collecting and exploiting user feedback to improve user satisfaction, but suffer from the absence of effective user review analytics tools. To facilitate mobile app developers discover the most “informative” user reviews from a large and rapidly increasing pool of user reviews, we present “AR-Miner” — a novel computational framework for App Review Mining, which performs comprehensive analytics from raw user reviews by (i) first extracting informative user reviews by filtering noisy and irrelevant ones, (ii) then grouping the informative reviews automatically using topic modeling, (iii) further prioritizing the informative reviews by an effective review ranking scheme, (iv) and finally presenting the groups of most “informative” reviews via an intuitive visualization approach. We conduct extensive experiments and case studies on four popular Android apps to evaluate AR-Miner, from which the encouraging results indicate that AR-Miner is effective, efficient and promising for app developers.},

    abstract = {Context
    Recent developments in requirements engineering (RE) methods have seen a surge in using machine-learning (ML) algorithms to solve some difficult RE problems. One such problem is identification and classification of non-functional requirements (NFRs) in requirements documents. ML-based approaches to this problem have shown to produce promising results, better than those produced by traditional natural language processing (NLP) approaches. Yet, a systematic understanding of these ML approaches is still lacking.
    Method
    This article reports on a systematic review of 24 ML-based approaches for identifying and classifying NFRs. Directed by three research questions, this article aims to understand what ML algorithms are used in these approaches, how these algorithms work and how they are evaluated.
    Results
    (1) 16 different ML algorithms are found in these approaches; of which supervised learning algorithms are most popular. (2) All 24 approaches have followed a standard process in identifying and classifying NFRs. (3) Precision and recall are the most used matrices to measure the performance of these approaches.
    Finding
    The review finds that while ML-based approaches have the potential in the classification and identification of NFRs, they face some open challenges that will affect their performance and practical application.
    Impact
    The review calls for the close collaboration between RE and ML researchers, to address open challenges facing the development of real-world ML systems.
    Significance
    The use of ML in RE opens up exciting opportunities to develop novel expert and intelligent systems to support RE tasks and processes. This implies that RE is being transformed into an application of modern expert systems.}
