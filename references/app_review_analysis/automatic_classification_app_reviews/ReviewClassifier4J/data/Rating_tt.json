    "comment": "This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.\n\nThere are a couple formatting issue suggestions:\n\n1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.\n2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?\n3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.\n\nKeep up the good work!",

Within one minute I knew it did not work and there was NO refund button for me to press.  $15 is a lot of money for me and I bought the app with the understanding that I could try it for 15 minutes.  Here's my update - the app has not been refunded yet.   I tried again to use it and it crashes when accessing Google drive.   It also crashes half the time opening my power point and has no editing features when it does open.   This app would be terrible were it free.   For a high price it's ridiculous",

    "comment": "Missing a very basic feature\tThis is a great camera app that's useless to me because they've neglected a basic function. First the pros: the interface is intuitive and easy to use, the self-timer is fully adjustable (rather than just having a 2 and 10 second option for example), and the editing options are also easy to use. However, I will not be using the app because of the lack of manual cropping. The crop menu gives several size options, you choose one, and the app....automatically crops your picture. Do you see where this is going wrong? I suppose if your pictures were always perfectly centered and you just wanted to get the correct dimensions, this would work. Me, I don't always have my perfectly composed shot. I use my phone to take many pictures of my (moving) children, and often I have a lot of space on one side that needs to be cropped out to make a good shot. A camera app that automatically crops in the center and doesn't give me the option to at least adjust the cropping is absolutely useless to me, and a complete waste of the money I paid for it. I looked all over for this feature, thinking they can't POSSIBLY have neglected such a basic function, but it is glaringly missing.",
