When you rate a driver and they don't rate you back, your rate still shows on their profile. I don't think this is either fair or right from your part. I believe there should be an option to change your rate after you see the other persons rate. I always rate people truthfully, but it happened to me a day ago that I got a rate that was subjective, not objective. Apparently I didn't sit well with the guy. I texted him the size of my bag, when I came the car couldn't open the back door. Also the thing for the speed didn't work so he was practically driving by feeling which I didn't like at all. It made me feel very insecure. And plus I was in the front and the firsy person to die when there is a car crash it's not the driver but the person next to him/her. I reported him here on Bla Bla Car but there is no choice to put for a vehicle that isn't functional. I didn't comment on that because I didn't want to upset the other passangers and I was let with a three hour drive that was very unsecure and caused me extreme emotional distress. I left a good grade because everything was fine, the drive, etc. But on second thought I should have put a different grade and warn others, but now the app doesn't allow me. I sent a request to change the rating but we'll see how that goes. If I would be able to change the rate and if the app changes the voting thingy I will give this app a straight five stars because this app deserves it. But I hope I can solve this quickly.</td>\n",

Although account is still blocked, I received a mail on 6th october stating that, as I have failed to pay the dues for around last 71 days, they would take legal action against me, ever since I received this mail, I have sent several mails to ola grievance and other support teams, asking to unblock my account first, thereafter I would clear the dues, as I have never denied to clear the dues, but till now, not received any valid response from them.
