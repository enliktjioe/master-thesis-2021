The biggest thing for me is customer service. Getting prompt responses rarely occurs. In fact, the last message I sent them, I never got a response. Additionally, I had a terrible experience yesterday and I've been trying to report it since yesterday afternoon. But, there's a glitch in that each time I click \"report tab\" under driver misconduct, it doesn't load. Then, to add to that, when I try to report via the safety tab, again, it doesn't load. The rest of the app is working fine. Last time I reported a glitch with the app, I was told that I needed to check thar the app was updated and u had my GPS turned all, all of which was already in place. After I shared that, there's no response. There seem to be a number of glitches and this can be a safety issue. Honestly, there should be functioning tool in place that makes it easy to report a ride either as it's occurring as, or as soon after. Twice, I had issues with a driver and I struggled to report it.

However, my driver did not take the correct turn and an extra 20 minutes was added to my journey which already inconvenienced me by making me 20 minutes late but then I was charged £20.50 for my journey, 2.5x the rate I was quoted. When I complained support said they couldn’t refund me as they’re unable to do that from their end but could offer me a discount code for future journeys. As a student living in London I don’t feel this is adequate as it is not what I had budgeted for, I accept that people make mistakes but I do not think I should be charged for my drivers mistake, especially when it increased the amount he was paid for the journey to £14.50 as it could encourage drivers to make similar ‘mistakes’ if bolt continues with this ridiculous refund policy</td>\n",
