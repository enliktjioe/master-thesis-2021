    "\n",
    "            • FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if theyre in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phones Internet connection rather than your cellular plans voice minutes.

    "\n",
    "            • GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n",

    "\n",
    "            • SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phones existing address book.\n",
    "\n",
    "            • ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, youre always logged in so you dont miss messages. No more confusion about whether youre logged in or logged out.\n",
    "\n",
    "            • QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so theres no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n",
    "\n",
    "            • OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n",
