I ordered a XL car to help with moving a mirror and a bassinet to my destination, he took 15 minutes to get here, was on a call via loud speaker with a friend/family member. I asked if I could put my stuff into the boot as I was moving house and collecting the last items I had at my previous home. He declined and the person he was speaking to on the phone also got involved also. He then said it was my fault for ordering the wrong type of car, I told him I ordered the biggest car option on bolt. He said I would have to find another car and then told ME to cancel the drive. I refused so as he drove off he shouted something and left me, my baby and my things in the cold. Then to make matters worse, he cancelled the trip and put the reason as me ‘NOT SHOWING UP’. I will never use Bolt again, I am so angry and disgusted. \\n\\nAVOID.'"

So apparently bolt encourages people to sit still and not move in the car, which was the response I got from customer service and no refund. The second time, I had a dental appointment and ordered a cab, the driver came and then he said where are you going? As soon as he found out what the location was, he got frustrated and swore and said “this is too far man I’m tired”. I asked why he had accepted it in the first place if he didn’t want to go too far. I didn’t get any proper explanation and no apology. I was in pain because of my dental extraction too. So I had to cancel from my end because he said he couldn’t do it. He said he would text bolt and let them know. And I messaged Bolt 3 days ago and still no reply. They have charged me £3 for this trip that didn’t happen. Terrible terrible drivers and very bad customer service. When incidents like this happened with Uber, they would always refund and apologise.\n",

Because as a new potential loyal customer I was happy to pay what was shown on my phone screen with the promo code. After contacting them through their support number. I was offered a £20 discount off my next ride which It was unacceptable. The app showed to me that it would have been £26-£30.50, then taken £30.50 from my account before the ride was even begun or the driver has arrived at the pick up point, then was refunded at the end of my ride and charge extra? Why do you provide a promotion if I am not even getting one? It’s unacceptable to offer and promote a promo (discount) for a ride if the customer does not receive it. If your app calculates that it will charge its customer a certain amount of money, why does at the end of the calculated route show that the customer has to pay more? If initially the customer is meant to pay the price that you guys make up, cuz you can’t even explain to me why would be better to just show that price, not a discounted ride and then I end up paying more for what I was offered.

But no, the company then charged me an additional of £18.50 total of £49. If I have known that I would have paid almost £20 more for a ride I would have looked for an alternative and that’s what I initially intended. However this app was the cheapest out of Lyftt and Uber as a lot of people not just me have definitely used before or would rather. Because as a new potential loyal customer I was happy to pay what was shown on my phone screen with the promo code. After contacting my phone screen through my phone screen support number. I was offered a £20 discount off my next ride which a £20 discount was unacceptable. this app app showed to me that this app would have been £26-£30.50, then taken £30.50 from my account before a ride was even begun or the driver has arrived at the pick up point, then was refunded at the end of a ride and charge extra? Why do you provide a promotion if I am not even getting one? It’s unacceptable to offer and promote a promo (discount) for a ride if the customer does not receive the customer. If your app calculates that your app will charge your app customer a certain amount of money, why does at the end of the calculated route show that its customer has to pay more? If initially its customer is meant to pay the price that you guys make up, cuz you can’t even explain to me why would be better to just show that price, not a discounted ride and then I end up paying more for what I was offered. Very disappointed, if this is not fraud then I don’t know!\n",
