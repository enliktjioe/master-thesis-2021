Literally every single time the estimated car arrival time is out by a great deal. Just now when confirming a trip, we did so based on the 4 minute away estimation of the nearest car. We waited outside our hotel for more like 14 minutes before the car actually got there. First the time went up to 5 minutes then to 7 minutes, then it just stayed 6 minutes for a few minutes and slowly started going back down again (not in a real-time minute counter but Uber’s much slower minute counter). There wasn’t really much traffic on the street so I don’t understand how can the estimation be out by this much. I would much prefer to know the actual estimated arrival time as opposed to standing by the road like an idiot. I definitely would have dried my hair this morning if I knew about the extra 10 minutes wait time, instead I was standing on the windy roadside for quarter of an hour with my wet hair. And this was pretty much the same with each ride ordered I’ve the past 10 days. Anywhere between double to triple the amount of estimated car arrival time we had to wait, not cool. Please make your app more accurate. For now I’m going to switch to Lyft for the last 4 days if our trip and see if they do a better estimation job. It’s just a shame as otherwise Uber would be a service I’d use and recommend more...</td>\n",

Recently I ended up giving a driver a bad review at the end of a trip as he had not been wearing a mask and had also been very rude, anyway I checked the app a couple of days later to order a new uber and to my shock and absolute disgust I had been charged £110 for my journey with no reason why or any notifications. I spent nearly an hour trying to get through to uber only for them to say I have to continue the issues through the app and that the only thing they could see was that I had “made a mess” I asked them to specify what this mess was and they said they don’t know it is just a mess.Now attempting to sort this issue through the app was a mission in itself and every response takes about 3 days I explained my side of the story explaining I had not made a mess in the car nor had anyone said to me whilst I was in the car that I had made a mess ,however I had been charged a cleaning fee out of nowhere. Now I understand that if I had been the one to make a mess that I would have to pay for the drivers cleaning fee etc however I am completely baffled at how I have done so. Anyway I will not be using uber again as now I have had £110 taken out of my account so I can not afford cabs anyway. In future I will stick to other apps as Uber’s customer service when dealing with problems is absolutely atrocious and requires extreme patience.</td>\n",

Whenever you attempt to order a car at a peak time for example 7:30am-8:30am suddenly the car availability goes from 5 mins away, to 15 - 20 minutes, this wouldn’t be so bad on its own, but the drivers then cancel the job just when the car is 3-4 minutes away,  requiring you to start the process over again, this continues until the “fare multiplier”, a feature which is meant to compensate drivers with extra cash at slow times in accordance with supply and demand, reaches a number that drivers are satisfied with; then suddenly, as if by magic, there are a plethora of cars available at the typical “5 mins away” timeframe again.  Unfortunately, by this time you have missed your appointment.  Uber seems unable to resolve this issue making the service completely useless at peak times.  At all other times however, the app and service are peerless.  - One final tip for Uber users: one may minimise the problem during peak times by ordering from a more expensive, upgraded car class, for example, ‘exec’ or ‘lux’. This workaround leads me to reason that the problem is due to the tension between the London government squeezing Uber for more revenues by imposing regulations, thereby urging the standard-class Uber driver to fraudulently ‘game the system’ in order to make a half a shilling. Unfortunately, the customer it is the customer who bears the result of this driving them to use other services, such as Addison Lee where a car may be ordered in advance, and whom are highly reliable.</td>\n",

I was going to visit some friends on Saturdaynight (15th of Dec) and I was supposed to leave my place around 7pm. An hour earlier I used the uber app to check the fare for the destination I was going to. I was really surprised when I saw that the estimated price for my trip was in the range between £75 and £100, and that was four times higher than what I would usually pay for that destination (£20-£25). I thought that there was something wrong with the app, so I waited 15 mins and tried again. The second time I checked the app showed an estimated price of £24-£36, if the time of leaving was 6:50pm. To secure the price I prebooked(40 min in advance)the ride for 6:50 at the estimated price of £24-£36. \n",
       "You cannot imagine my biggest disappointment when already on my way to my friends I received a message from Uber saying that I was going to be charged £101-£133 (!) for my trip. I couldn’t believe it, so I asked the driver if that could be possible. He said that it was not possible and there was probably a problem with the server, but he did not know what the rate was. \n",
       "I thought that maybe he was right as that’s what had happened when I was checking the rates earlier. However, when I arrived at my friends I got an email with a receipt for £111. \n",
       "I am really frustrated and disappointed as I believe that I have been misled and unfairly charged by Uber. \n",
       "I insist on being compensated for the overcharge and the price to be adjusted to the initially estimated price (which was actually the reason to use your services)\n",
       "If I knew that I was going to pay such a ridiculous amount of money for less than 15 miles journey I would have used the public transport!!!</td>\n",

The notification stays on and updates the time but the driver fails to appear in the app. This happens weather I click the notification or restart the app itself. Did you recently make some changes to your backend?  Also, the notification will fight with other notifications to be on top, resulting in a hillariou situation where the notification jumps around the screen and is difficult to click.  The driver finally appears when he arrived, I assume this happens because a different event is dispatched from the server when he arrives?</td>\n",
