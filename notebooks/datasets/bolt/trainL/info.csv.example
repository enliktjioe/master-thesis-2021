I cancel the ride to avoid 0.25p unnecessary charges and since the driver kept going I thought why wait, I’m in a rush. Then I’m charged £6 cancellation fee which didn’t show up on my screen. What’s worse is that the ride was less than £6 and I can’t get the money reimbursed. Only some £10 promo code because they don’t provide refunds in situations like this he said.

1314,JaimeGreenwich,False,"very bad experience today - first ride aswell.. way to go bolt! 

i was quoted 13.50 on the app for canary wharf to greenwich - ended up being 16.50 - at least tell me it could be higher at the start.. but ok:

Onto the scam bit:

i was on my phone but when i looked up i saw my driver had missed the rotherthide tunnel ( on purpose?). In hindsight i was on my phone so what other missed turns did he take?

the drive took 40m on a sunday- i remember entering the car and the satnav said 30. there wasnt much traffic either..

the catch? its impossible to see the route your driver took ( uber allows you to) on the app

So did i pay 3£ more because my driver took wrong routes on purpose - my feeling is that thats what happned.

I checked the price of both Uber and bolt, chose bolt. Then the price went up as I got the first riders promotion code. Still it was okay price, so I gave a shot. The driver arriving estimate was wrong, he took much longer to get me than the estimation. I hired Bolt XL, tho it was such small car. Don’t know what’s bolt’s standard for XL. I had some stuffs and one bike, I couldn’t load the bike at all. I had to let the driver goes alone with my belongings and I had to cycle, mental! The thing is when I and the driver arrived at the destination, bolt charged me double than I already paid. As the result, it was more expensive then Uber. It’s meaningless to use bolt. I complained about the price to the customer service team, tho they delayed to refund me forever!!! Failing reaching out the driver can’t be the reason for not refunding me!!!! 
Remember, bolt is more expensive if you use the promotion code rather than using your card, which means it’s a trick!!! 
Also you can be charged more then the expectation.

1329,Eve 🖤🖤🖤🖤,False,"I was quoted a fair of £7-£8 for a journey home, the return of the outward journey that had costed me £7.50 with bolt. I booked my bolt under the pretence that it would cost between £7-£8 for my journey. However, my driver did not take the correct turn and an extra 20 minutes was added to my journey which already inconvenienced me by making me 20 minutes late but then I was charged £20.50 for my journey, 2.5x the rate I was quoted. When I complained support said they couldn’t refund me as they’re unable to do that from their end but could offer me a discount code for future journeys. As a student living in London I don’t feel this is adequate as it is not what I had budgeted for, I accept that people make mistakes but I do not think I should be charged for my drivers mistake, especially when it increased the amount he was paid for the journey to £14.50 as it could encourage drivers to make similar ‘mistakes’ if bolt continues with this ridiculous refund policy",1,Charged 2.5x quoted rate,2020-03-09 15:28:29

1336,WKLondon,False,The app is not particularly accurate. Noticed it the first time I used it and thought it was a one off. But on my second ride the same things happened.You book the ride and the app tells you the driver is 9 minutes away. Ten minutes later the driver is still 9 minutes away according to the app. You try to calm the driver and get an error message. When I was about to cancel the ride the driver shows up but according to the app he is still 8 minutes away. The issues don’t stop there - the route that you are given is the long way round doubling the cost of the ride without any real benefits to the passenger. According to Waze (which In my experience is a lot more accurate time wise) taking the long way around London is just six minutes quicker than driving through London.

1339,Sunday Bradley,False,"Where to start with Bolt. This isn’t a rant, just an honest review to help other customers.  The positive is that they are much cheaper than uber, so if you can tolerate the negatives then stick with bolt. 
The drivers themselves are pleasant, similar to most taxi companies however, the company’s service - 1/10. 
1. The time in which they say they will pick you up is seldom true. Countless of times I’ve watched drivers times change and change, and the drivers go round in circles reaching my destination. So just know, that if you have to be somewhere in 20 minutes, book their taxi an extra 10 minutes earlier to compensate for their lack of time keeping. 
2. Their fare estimation. Even though they say for example, £8.50-£10.00 they will always charge the highest price and sometimes even more, even though it should have been an £8.50 ride. 
3. Map system. Whatever maps the drivers are using, doesn’t take the best route.

Second, drivers usually can’t reach the place where I’m waiting even if I put it on the map correctly. When they arrive they don’t call to ask if they can’t find me.

There was lots of demand on most taxi apps around 12-1am on Thursday night so I decided to download bolt and use my managers promo code for £14 off. 

I decided to wait a while to see if the prices would drop and they did. 
The app said it would cost me between £15-£25 so I booked as fast as possible to avoid the price raising again. 
 The next day I found out I was charged £54. 

Spoke with costumer service on the bolt app and was told the driver took a different route ‘for some reason’. Which is ridiculous because what’s to stop them from doing that to everyone else. They offered me a £10 voucher. 
After explaining that I was half asleep, didn’t realise the route being taken and expect a level of trust that the driver won’t elongate the journey to make some extra cash.
 Was told that it was to avoid traffic or certain types of accidents. 
Thursday 12/12/19 around 1am I don’t believe was any traffic. 

Just to add I never expected a full refund but at least the difference between what they estimated it would cost (20ish pounds) before I requested the taxi and what it actually cost (54 pounds). Very unprofessional service on both sides, the driver and the ‘support team’.

After I got off the my ride and I arrived home, the company refunds my £30.50 which was originally calculated that would be the highest I would have paid. But no, the company then charged me an additional of £18.50 total of £49. If I have known that I would have paid almost £20 more for my ride I would have looked for an alternative and that’s what I initially intended. However this app was the cheapest out of Lyftt and Uber as a lot of people not just me have definitely used before or would rather. Because as a new potential loyal customer I was happy to pay what was shown on my phone screen with the promo code. After contacting them through their support number. I was offered a £20 discount off my next ride which It was unacceptable. The app showed to me that it would have been £26-£30.50, then taken £30.50 from my account before the ride was even begun or the driver has arrived at the pick up point, then was refunded at the end of my ride and charge extra? Why do you provide a promotion if I am not even getting one? It’s unacceptable to offer and promote a promo (discount) for a ride if the customer does not receive it. If your app calculates that it will charge its customer a certain amount of money, why does at the end of the calculated route show that the customer has to pay more? If initially the customer is meant to pay the price that you guys make up, cuz you can’t even explain to me why would be better to just show that price, not a discounted ride and then I end up paying more for what I was offered.

1374,Leesh1234556,False,"I had a used BOLT several times before this trip and I was happy with the service. I had no complaints at all. I was using all of their promotional offers and it was great. I was ready to say goodbye to Uber permanently. 

I had a very important meeting to make one morning so I made sure that I booked my travel with enough time to arrive EARLY as I’m aware of rush hour traffic in London.
My BOLT arrived in a timely manner, and the driver was very friendly and polite.

However, I ended up being 30 minutes late for my meeting because the route that the driver was being instructed to take by his app was poor. It made no sense because the route was taking me away from my destination (I know this because I drive and I know the area well) on top of that, there was no traffic at all! 

The driver agreed with me in saying that the route was ridiculous after we had been driving for about 15 minutes. He screenshotted the map, turned off his phone and I proceeded to direct him the rest of the way. 

I understand that things like this happen from time to time, but what infuriated me was the price I ended up paying for the journey (I paid £19.50 for a £6-£11 journey) and the lack of customer service from the BOLT team. I attempted to contact them on several occasions and they still haven’t gotten back to me. I haven’t even received an automated email or an automated message notifying me that my request is being dealt with. Every time I call to speak to someone it says “all of our lines are busy at the moment” over and over again with no option for you to wait/be put on hold. 

This is ridiculous. It shouldn’t take more than a day to resolve an issue like this. If the issue had been resolved in a timely manner, I wouldn’t be as annoyed as I am now. The fact that I have to chase the company for a resolution is out of order and I wouldn’t recommend using Bolt unless you want to lose your coin!

I will be returning to Uber because of this.
I will happily pay a few extra pounds for every journey knowing that if anything goes wrong I am covered and can be reimbursed where necessary. I am not impressed at all.",1,"I used to love BOLT, but then this happened...",2019-10-03 11:15:16

I was so shocked I called to ask for the original price of £9-12 and a refund on the difference. I was told I couldn’t get a refund but I could have an £8 deduction off of my next two trips. I declined as I will never use this thieving service ever again.",1,THEFT APP,2019-10-02 22:09:05

In regards to the first booking, I called the driver to give him more information about where I exactly stood and he said it's ok, but surprising after 4-5 minutes my app showed that the driver cancelled the booking. 
Wasting time, I booked another driver which showed me 8 minutes and I again trusted in Bolt service, waiting, waiting and waiting and how clever your drivers are! He didn't cancel it just because force me to go for cancellation. I didn't cancel and waited but I was already late and stuck by your drivers. 
I left the place as any normal people do! 
And the app eventually showed me the driver arrived and sounds funny but yes driver arrived after around 20 minutes. Seriously! I had to cancel it and yes obviously the person who lost money was me.This is unfair and I think I got ripped off.

I then inquired with Bolt after my trip about the promo code not working - and firstly trying to do so on their app was a nightmare (via the contact page, my message kept deleting while I done so on a moving train because my request had timed out, so I ended up re-writing it at least 3 times). And it has taken 10 days for the Bolt Customer Service team to come back to me advising that there is no proof I entered the promo code so they cannot do anything.

J’ai rejoint le chauffeur pour lui montrer le bug de l’application et nouvelle surprise la réservation passée « toute seule » était celle d’un van (soit un tarif de 60€ pour 15 minutes .. j’ai pu trouver le prix en simulant la course sur l’application alors que la course n’était pas encore annulée).

L’app est fonctionnelle mais pas vraiment optimisée car si l’on veut suivre l’arrivée du chauffeur, le GPS tourne et consomme de la batterie. Uber est bien meilleur sur ce domaine.

Pour l’instant, aux heures de pointe, la réservation ne fonctionne pas 1 fois sur 3 ou propose une voiture dans 20 minutes. Cela s’améliorera avec l’augmentation du nombre de chauffeurs.
En heures creuses, c’est moins de 5 minutes.

Dommage que l’on ne puisse pas réserver à l’avance. C’est un vrai manque.

Concernant les tarifs, cela sera proche d’Uber à terme (promo actuellement) mais au moins on sait que le chauffeur gagne plus.

69,TouchezEtoile,False,"J’utilise énormément les apps Uber/Chauffeur Privé/Taxify, et j’ai décidé d’arrêter d’utiliser Taxify. 

Évidemment c’était parfait quand il y avait de grosses promotions pour le lancement de leur app à Paris. J’attendais parfois longuement pour avoir un chauffeur, mais c’était tellement peu cher que ça en valait la peine. Puis les problèmes ont commencé à apparaître. 

- Les trajets sont plus longs et donc plus chers avec Taxify : ils ne fixent pas le prix lors de la commande, les chauffeurs prennent donc tout leur temps. 

- Le service client est inexistant : ça fait 3 semaines que je les ai contactés et relancés au sujet d’une course dont le prix a doublé parce que le chauffeur a eu un souci avec sa voiture, et je n’ai même pas eu ne serait-ce qu’une réponse automatique. Chez Uber, j’appuie sur un bouton pour expliquer mon problème et ils m’envoient un avoir automatiquement. Chez Chauffeur Privé, je n’ai juste jamais eu de problème donc aucune raison de contacter le service client. 

- À noter aussi qu’il y a beaucoup moins de voitures Taxify, donc une attente plus longue. 

Apparemment les chauffeurs sont mieux payés avec Taxify. Mais en tant que client, il n’y a aucun avantage à choisir Taxify plutôt qu’une des 2 autres apps, au contraire.

C’est mon chauffeur qui m’a alertée alors que j’avais fini la course en me disant de contacter le SAV, le montant était exorbitant, lui même était très étonné il a préféré me prévenir, et pas du tout annoncé ni validé.

J’ai contacté le SAV qui n’a jamais voulu m’entendre et m’a très clairement expliqué qu’il ne me rembourserait jamais. Ils ont même contacté le chauffeur (je leur avais demandé de le faire comme nous étions lui et moi très étonnée pour préciser la bonne foi). Évidemment, au lieu de reconnaître leur erreur ils lui ont dit que si il me remboursait ça serait avec largement de sa course bien sûr !

Je tiens à prévenir l’ensemble des usagers quant aux arnaques.

J’ai été récemment pris dans le piège, au lieu de payer 28€ ils m’ont fait payer 43€, la raison ? Une majoration 1.4 sur 2 minutes d’intervalle.

28€ initialement, je lance la course, le chauffeur m’appelle plusieurs fois pour connaître ma position etc (pour peut être me faire majorer ?) et quand je rentre chez moi, je me rends compte que ça m’a coûté 43€. Où est le bug ?

J’écris au support qui s’en fiche totalement, ne cherchant pas à comprendre, ni même entendre l’avis de l’utilisateur. On repassera pour l’expérience utilisateur, surtout quand celui ci avait utilisé leurs services quelques fois au moins. Plutôt on ne repassera pas, et sa communauté ne repassera pas.

1182,FanSert,False,"Je souhaite mettre en garde sur ce service qui contrairement à ses concurrents propose des prix alléchants mais contrebalancés ensuite par des suppléments abusifs. 

Pour exemple ma course d’hier soir estimée à 19.90 euros ( déjà un prix élevé en raison de l’heure et des conditions climatiques mauvaises - pluie) : trajet entre le 18è ( Lamarck) et le 12ème (Bastille). Durée : 20h52>21h33 et facturée au final 45.20 euros. Soit 23.99 euros de supplément justifié par le temps de course en sus (embouteillage et pluie) et non annoncés à la commande. Le service client renvoie vers les conditions générales de l’application. 

Il est évident que si la course avait été estimé à la hausse je n’aurais jamais pris ce transport. 45 euros étant le prix d’un taxi pour se rendre à l’aéroport ou faire un trajet extra-muros. Je subie une mausvaise estimatuon de l’application et aucun interlocuteur du service n’a fait de geste à mon égard malgré mes multiples messages.

“Please be informed that I contacted your driver. He explained to me that there were two closed roads so he was forced to take a longer route. He also informed you about it.
Unfortunately we are not in control of road works and since our prices are based on the mileage of the trip the final amount came higher.

Schwierig wird’s allerdings, wenn mal was mit einem Fahrer nicht stimmt: Als Mitfahrer gibt es keine Chance, die Fahrt auf eigenen Wunsch frühzeitig zu beenden, wenn man sich selbst unsicher fühlt, zum Beispiel. Dann gibt es auch keinerlei Hotline nur einen In-App-Message, worauf die Antwort vom Supportteam meist auf sich warten lässt. Ich hatte genau so einen Fall, bin gar nicht erst eingestiegen, der Fahrer hat die Fahrt aber dennoch in der App gestartet und meine Kreditkarte belastet, ohne dass ich einen Meter gefahren bin. Ich selbst war hilflos, musste mit ansehen, wie er weiter munter drauf los fährt oder sich dazu aufrafft, die Fahrt doch selbst zu beenden.

Den Fall gemeldet. Vom Bolt Supportteam (Marc) kam nichts außer „tut uns Leid“ und einen Spargutschein (der mich allerdings nie erreicht hat)! Vllt meldet sich auf diese Bewertung ja nochmal jemand von Bolt ... 

Doof is außerdem, dass automatisch nach ein paar Cancellations (z.B. weil die Bewertungen der Fahrer einem persönlich nicht gut genug sind) automatisch für 24h gesperrt wird. Das kann in manchen Situationen echt heikel und unpassend sein.

Intenté abrir varias veces el mapa para cerciorarme y el mapa se cargaba pero no marcaba el límite. Bastante desesperante la verdad!!!

Con lo cual tuve que poner la bicicleta en pausa y hacer las gestiones que iba a hacer. 

Luego de una hora y pico... me enviaron mensaje informando que anulaban la pausa porque se había excedido el tiempo y que me cargaban 12,11€. Me sorprendí y me molesté mucho, ya que Vds. pueden ver el tiempo que una bicicleta está en ruta, en reposo, y cuantas veces se accede a la App para ver el mapa y cualquier gestión que haga un cliente. 

Cuando terminé las gestiones, volví a buscar la bici y la dejé donde mismo la había cogido, y sorpresa!!! me volvió a decir que no podía dejarla ahí porque no estaba en zona. Volví a abrir el mapa y seguía sin marcar la zona, pero esta vez no estaba dispuesta a pagar 12,11€ por un viaje de menos de 5km y de cómo mucho 25 minutos. Así que insistí, insistí hasta tres veces y finalmente aceptó el aparcamiento solicitando una foto que también envié. 

En fin, que intenté cuando tuve el problema contactar con ALGUIEN de Bolt, y no me contestaron ni al mensaje desde la App ni al messenger en facebook, busque teléfono de atención al cliente, servicio técnico y nada de nada. 

La verdad me sentí abandonada, muy decepcionada y decidí darme de baja de la aplicación. 

Hoy he entrado en mis gastos bancarios y veo que me han cobrado 5,11€. 
Sinceramente no sé si es lo que corresponde porque nunca he podido acceder a mi historial de viajes para comprobarlo (que ya he hecho varios) me dice “sin viajes, de momento. Regresa y pide tu primer viaje”, o sea, como que no he hecho ningún viaje y como estuve más de media hora intentando resolver el problema del aparcamiento, no sé cuál es el límite de viaje que han puesto.

The only thing I am missing with new updates is ability to share a ride with my friends conveniently. As I cannot change the address, the app kind of assumes that I only take one stop trips. This is not true because sometimes the destination changes during the trip (get mor eprecise information about the location) or more oftenly I will take a friend somewhere midway to the destination. Now I have to rely on making it verbally clear to the driver which is what I disliked about taking a taxi in the first place. Ideally it would be good to get a possibility to share the cost with a friend as well, but a good start would be allowing multiple destinations however it is more convenient.",4,"The most heavily used app in my phone, but please make ridesharing happen",2018-07-15 15:16:08
2,★ Holyfield,False,"My first impression about Taxify was good. But some updates are making me less impressed about Taxify. 

There was an option to choose car based on price an estimated arrival time. This isn’t available anymore. Both the prices and arrival time are like roulette now, you never know what you get. 

The most important recognition element of cars is missing!! The color of car. But on many cases you have to be like a mad dog to guess which car is for you. Color will help to separate easily potential cars!! 

Many drivers don’t speak native language and you are unable to explain better route or exact location where to stop. 

Rating system is useless as this doesn’t provide any valuable information for drivers and service providers. If there is complain, it should be easy to add instead of those meaningless stars. Also instead of stars there should be an option for extra tip for driver, which is not affected by any Taxify fees, so I can easily make an compliment for good drivers by paying some tip, instead of those stupid stars.

Now after the update to Bolt everything changed. They added a new ride called Bolt. I don’t mind it and it’s not a bad thing, but all other aspects of the app have worsened. The cars are always busy and the prices are also higher than they were before. It felt like the shrunk the amount of cars. I wanted to request a taxify and the app said all were busy. I wated some time and I saw the prices go up in like 2 minuets from 3€ to 3.90€ to 4.50€.

4,LeaderOfTheFreeWorld,False,"The concept of the taxify app is great, makes finding a taxi a lot easier and the rides cheaper.
However, the distinction between taxify regular and taxify comfort cars is close to none, while the price difference is quite noticeable. I have gotten older/worse condition cars from the comfort than regular. I find that there should be tougher restrictions to classify as a comfort class driver.
An example of why this is needed:
There are times when you want the ride to be comfortable and presentable, when going to a theatre or an important meeting. The Tesla is not always available so the next option is taxify comfort on which I can barely rely on these days. It is sometimes even embarrassing what cars you can get from that category, far from comfort.

Another small thing I would like to point out is that since the new logo is all green, people are mistakenly opening it as whatsapp.
