0,Tkay_Browning,False,I love bolt. I don‚Äôt use uber often because one ride even if it‚Äôs short is like ¬£11. Whereas from my high street to my house is ¬£3. Not only that but their drivers are SUPER friendly! I was sick one day (my first time using bolt) and the driver was so understanding and encouraged me throughout my journey. Bolt is 100% recommended by me. I don‚Äôt write reviews so that‚Äôs how you know I defiantly recommend it. My Instagram name is: TeeKezi if you wish to get in contact with me about bolt.

1,Livvii_xo,False,"So annoyed with this app!! Definitely the worst of all of them. Sticking with Uber from now on. The driver arrival times are fake! It says the drivers have arrived when they are far away. Today the driver arrived and within a minute started driving away as if planning to do the route of my journey. I called customer support and was told that the driver was just around the corner of my house even though on the map it showed him miles away. Was told to look around the corner, which I did and the driver wasn‚Äôt there. Customer support then contacted the driver who claims he waited for 6 minutes and customer support claims on their system it showed he waited for 6 minutes, which is funny because their system was showing that he was there even though he wasn‚Äôt. With the time of me ordering the car, waiting the 2/3 minutes for him to get to me and my call to the driver and customer service there is no possible way the driver waiting 6 minutes. I even have the screenshots to prove it. Then customer support tells me I‚Äôve not been charged and they are offering me ¬£3 off the next journey. #%# %*^! This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened, the drivers do as they please! Stick with Uber, this app is trash!

2,Kazem Sharan,False,"I‚Äôve been using bolt for a month now. I had a few good journeys but 2 horrendous ones recently. The first occasion I was told to not cross my legs in the car because it ‚Äúmight‚Äù touch his chair. So apparently bolt encourages people to sit still and not move in the car, which was the response I got from customer service and no refund. The second time, I had a dental appointment and ordered a cab, the driver came and then he said where are you going? As soon as he found out what the location was, he got frustrated and swore and said ‚Äúthis is too far man I‚Äôm tired‚Äù. I asked why he had accepted it in the first place if he didn‚Äôt want to go too far. I didn‚Äôt get any proper explanation and no apology. I was in pain because of my dental extraction too. So I had to cancel from my end because he said he couldn‚Äôt do it. He said he would text bolt and let them know. And I messaged Bolt 3 days ago and still no reply. They have charged me ¬£3 for this trip that didn‚Äôt happen. Terrible terrible drivers and very bad customer service.

3,Doctor A Theo,False,"To make things clear, I am not a regular reviewer for anything at all and I certainly never leave negative reviews (until now).  After my experience this morning however I feel I must write a review to warn other users. 
I have been using Bolt regularly since it was launched in London. 
Today was the second time that I have booked a ride and the driver drove in completely the wrong direction. I spoke to the driver who claimed that I should just restart the app. After waiting in the rain for over 15 minutes, I called customer service. The man I spoke to on the phone sounded completely indifferent as I explained the situation, resulting in being late for a work meeting. There wasn‚Äôt any recognition of the absurdly poor service that this represents, let alone any sort of apology. At the end of the call, as if reading from a script, he informed me that as a gesture of good will he would be sending a ¬£5 voucher. I thanked him for the generosity and declined this as I am not planning to use this unreliable app again.

4,Maria348794,False,"I have used the app 3 or 4 times and I thought it was great until today. I booked a cab, I waited outside and I saw him driving past me and leaving my street. I called him many times and he didn‚Äôt pick up. I called Bolt customer service and also didn‚Äôt respond. I wasted 15 minutes waiting to see if the driver would cancel the trip since he didn‚Äôt return, and I had to forcefully cancel it myself as I was already running late to my appointment and I couldn‚Äôt sit down there to wait until he felt like cancelling. I had to pay ¬£6 which equals the cost of the trip, for a trip that didn‚Äôt happen. I had to book another cab and spend double the amount I should have spent originally.

I have called countless times the customer service and they didn‚Äôt even pick up the phone, also messaged. I feel like I have been scammed. 

I have been told that is common for drivers to play around when people book, then they drive off and wait for the customer to be tired of waiting so the customer can cancel the trip and the driver gets money for free. This is so unacceptable.......",1,I feel scammed,2019-11-04 15:03:04
5,19RN20,False,"I‚Äôm so appalled at the attitude of the last driver I ordered from you. Three people recommended your services and I trusted those opinions. I‚Äôve only taken four trips with Bolt and not ONE driver has worn a mask including the trips taken with my 7 month old baby. I ordered a XL car to help with moving a mirror and a bassinet to my destination, he took 15 minutes to get here, was on a call via loud speaker with a friend/family member. I asked if I could put my stuff into the boot as I was moving house and collecting the last items I had at my previous home. He declined and the person he was speaking to on the phone also got involved also. He then said it was my fault for ordering the wrong type of car, I told him I ordered the biggest car option on bolt. He said I would have to find another car and then told ME to cancel the drive. I refused so as he drove off he shouted something and left me, my baby and my things in the cold. Then to make matters worse, he cancelled the trip and put the reason as me ‚ÄòNOT SHOWING UP‚Äô.

6,Nutra D,False,"I found the Bolt app very useful to use from time to time while I was in Lagos, Nigeria for two months. It was a Godsend. It worked well most of the time. The pick up times were usually good, about 6 - 12 minutes and the drivers were good at locating me. There is an option to call the drivers, so I was also able to give them some guidance when they needed it, since you can track them approaching you on the app. 

The drivers were also very friendly, helpful and polite. All the taxis I traveled in were air conditioned, which was very soothing for travel in the sauna which is Lagos. 

If you use it for transport to Lagos International Airport I recommend you hail them before you finish packing, as I did find that the longest arrival time of 21 minutes was unfortunately when I needed transport to the Airport. And even if you are not based too far from the Airport, allow for at least an hour travel time, as there is often a hold up on the route to the Airport. 

But overall I give the Czech tech firm that produced this app very high marks and thank them for contributing to the ease of travel in Nigeria. 

Let me not forget to mention that the fares are also very reasonable, compared to a conventional taxi. It was also easy to cancel without being charged if the ETA was too long.",4,"Very good, very useful!",2019-08-14 19:49:48

I called the support they apologised and lied to me saying they will put 50¬£ worth of rides to my account. The next day my account was disabled, bolt demanded i provide evidence or they will dismiss this case.

8,km.i,False,"I used Bolt since my friend recommended it to me as it was a bit cheaper than Uber but I have never had so many occasions where the drivers were just so unprofessional.
Recent one being the driver notified me that it was at the location but I couldn‚Äôt find him anywhere and I was at the start of the road so I called him asking where he was and I‚Äôm right in front of the house. He just kept saying how he‚Äôs here and I‚Äôm not. And I was telling him I‚Äôm right outside and repeated the address to him. He again responded with he was there.

9,Godesquire,False,"Recently we used Taxify for my wife to collect our daughter from school.

When the Taxify arrived he parked in the wrong location but my wife located him and got into the car he subsequently said he‚Äôd not been told where to go - my wife told him to go to Kappara to our daughters school, he asked her where that was and when she explained he told her he didn‚Äôt want to go there and told her to get out of the vehicle - then I found out Taxify have charged me for the ride via my credit card !!! 

I complained via the application (3 times) and received no response. I returned the email (showing the invoice had been charged) referencing my complaint - no response. 

So effectively they stranded my wife - left my 5 year old daughter at school without pickup (fortunately we got another cab otherwise this complaint would be far worse) -  and charged me for doing so and then refused to speak to me about this incident. I can only assume they believe people will simply be quiet as they effectively take their money and don‚Äôt feel the need to offer an explanation of their actions.

17,more ways to take your money,False,"They have been ok in the past, (early days)

Final straw for me was when three cancelled on me while it was chucking it down with rain leaving me waiting for over half an hour. 

One car was supposedly a minute away. The other apparently had arrived when on the map he was 8 minutes away. The third cancelled and I was left with a spinning wheel saying updating service, or similar.

One of the problems is a lot of the drivers have all the cab apps and use them all simultaneously to their advantage. Which in my case meant when it‚Äôs pouring with rain and cabs are in demand they‚Äôll use Uber because the surcharge means they‚Äôll get more than from the other cab companies.

15 minutes later, the driver, who was about 3 blocks away, marked himself as though he had arrived at the pick up point. When I tried to call him, he hung up repeatedly. A couple of minutes later, he then marked the ride as ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù.

Taxify is MUCH cheaper than getting a random taxi off the street too. (I did this once and was ridiculously over-charged and he spoke no English).

I‚Äôve been using your app for a while and have found it useful to compare prices across providers. However there are a number of issues that need addressing:
1. Live update of cab doesn‚Äôt always give an accurate read so cabs are often late 
2. If you try to cancel because of a driver issue - cab isn‚Äôt moving, won‚Äôt answer when you call, taking too long - the customer is penalised with next cabs being late or a charge
3. There is no option to live chat or phone a customer service provider if there is an issue before you are in the car

He was talking and looking back at me on the motorway, and I felt very uncomfortable. It was like he wanted this job to be over with as soon as possible so he could make as much money as he could.
Afterwards I complained to one of the bolt team. Not only did they not compensate me. They said I had to prove these incidents had happened or they can‚Äôt do anything.....What sort of a rule is that!??

1044,Mia Medot,False,"I would have given negative stars if I had a choice. I called a cab via bolt a couple weeks ago to go from Westferry to Spitalsfield Market. The driver accepted my request and called to confirm where I was going. And he confirmed he would be there in 2 mins. So he arrived, I got into the car, he suddenly said, oh you are going to congestion zone, I m not going. And he basically said he doesn‚Äôt want to go he won‚Äôt go in many ways. But I was already sitting on the car. So he kicked me out of the car. Instead cancelling/completing my trip, he then went on driving with the app still showing that I was on the ride. So I called their Helpdesk, told them this incident. And I said I want to make a compliant about the driver. So the guy on the other end of the line said ok we will give him a warning. So I asked what‚Äôs gonna happen if he gets a warning, he will still be allowed on the platform and repeat his behaviour. The guys said yeah he will get a few warning then of course we will off board him. I said ok I want someone to email me to let me know the result of my complaint. He agrees. But then nothing. I heard nothing from Bolt. If they don‚Äôt have strict rules about drivers‚Äô conduct, how can they ensure the safety of their customers? If they don‚Äôt take complaint and feedback seriously, do they even intend to improve the service? Or do they just want to get as much investor‚Äôs money as possible and sell the app and retire?

1096,JT Deen,False,"I had used a discount on bolt which allowed me 60% off my next 5 journeys up until the 25th August 2019. I don‚Äôt like using my card details especially with cab apps as they may take more than the fare. I had ordered a cab at 06:30, 06:31 I received a call from the driver who said they would be there soon and similarly on the app it said he‚Äôd be here in 5 minutes. 12 minutes go by and the arrival of the driver had been saying  1 minute for 4 minutes straight. I looked on the map and the driver was heading to my destination instead of my pick up point and even after trying to call him through the app, the icon didn‚Äôt let me. It only let me message him and even after that, no response. I couldn‚Äôt even call back the number he had called me on because he had been using a number from the main switchboard and didn‚Äôt go through when I tried. I cancelled the journey and when I tried to rebook it, I left no money on the card I used on the app as the journey I was taking was ¬£6 and when I booked the journey it said the promo covered the journey. I use Monzo so when I get charged I get notified immediately. Why was ¬£10 attempted to be taken for a ¬£5-6 journey?! And when the driver arrived after multiple attempts of trying to book, he said aggressively ‚ÄúStop booking, you have no money in your account‚Äù. At that point I walked off and had to take TfL to work because this was the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had with a cab service ever. This may not be everyone‚Äôs experience but you‚Äôre only as good as you‚Äôre weakest link.

1115,filiz H,False,"They are the most worse company. Disgusting drivers and disgusting costumer service. First time I used Bolt the fair came in a lot higher then the highest expected price didn‚Äôt think much of it just thought because of traffic etc. Second time I kept watch on the drivers satnav and right Infront of my eyes saw him ignore the satnav and purposely took a longer route. Now be it was about 10pm over the Christmas period  I had all three of my children with me and didn‚Äôt want to say anything with the plan to get into contact with the costumer service team. 
On making the phone call and explaining the situation it came back that he did indeed ignore the route the Bolt satnav had told him to take so in other words to get more money from me he went the longer route. Disgusting human! Costumer service gave me a ¬£5 good will gesture as well as the ¬£5 in the extra fair cost. So again it came to me having to arrange a traci for my brother his wife and children to get home. I ordered the cab with using the ¬£5 voucher looked up the fastest route from mine to my brothers and proceeded to track the journey via the app. And guess what? Guy did the exact same thing. Instead of doing a straight right down the middle route he went up and away from my address around and back down. Google‚Äôs maps that night gave me the quickest route and it should of only been a 35/40 mins journey which turned into a 1 hour and 25 min journey so you can imagine the fair price. I was absolutely livid. I screen recorded me going from my google search which showed the direct route then into the app and recorded the whole journey. Next day I again called costumer service after submitting a formal complaint through the app with the screen recording and screen shots of the driver fair that was expected and the fair it ended up to be. Again they made me right in what I was saying but refused to refund the money into my bank account on the basis it would be unfair on the driver. Instead offered me a voucher with money of my next few journeys. That voucher added up to ¬£20 from the added extra fair! I pointed out why in the hell am I going to accept that when the money is going straight back into your sick and disgusting company. Your company is a disgrace and your drivers are equally that to. Unsafe drivers with green cards. How can you employ people who are so sly and devious! Costumer service made me right but would not accept any wrong doing. How can that be.

1195,hi0997,False,"I‚Äôve had 3 really bad journeys and I‚Äôve only used it 5 times: 

One time the driver took all the space for his seat so there was LITERALLY no leg room at the back I had to slide my feet in the middle leaning so that I could actually sit 

Second time we were all going to a club but tipsy but still were very well aware of what was going on apart from our one friend that was really drunk and was sitting at the front next to the driver and the driver took advantage of her, kissing her whilst driving for atleast 1.4 miles we had to threaten him until he could stop, and actually drop us to our destination. I would complain if I could but I didn‚Äôt book the bolt in so I can‚Äôt 

Third time which is last night the driver didn‚Äôt know where he was going (which seems to happen a lot with bolt the drivers they ring you up before hand and start stressing you out about meet up points but if you‚Äôre not a taxi driver then how the hell would you know where to go) he told me he‚Äôll meet up at certain place but wasn‚Äôt sure so I told him it should be alright considering Uber drivers come here all the time. He was at the end of the road stopped his car and I was walking towards him whilst on the phone he LITERALLY started shouting on the phone ‚Äòwhy did you bring me here, this is a bus lane, what‚Äôs wrong with you, you did this on purpose‚Äô. He didn‚Äôt even give a chance to defend myself so I hung up immediately and cancelled my journey cause I wasn‚Äôt gonna get in the car with a driver like that. Booked an Uber after and literally 10 seconds after the driver came and picked me up from the same spot üôÑ 

I normally let stuff pass through but they really do have a problem and the management really needs to focus on who they‚Äôre hiring",1,I‚Äôd give it 0 stars if I could,2019-11-11 08:40:30
1197,mmhvffc,False,"P.S I would have given then 0 stars to half a star 

I had ordered a cab from Crystal Palace to Peckham the estimated price was ¬£6 pounds to ¬£6.50 the Man charge me ¬£14 to go from Crystal Palace to Peckham. When I logged back onto the app to book another cab the driver was still driving around as if I was still in the car I had to call him to ask him to complete my trip so I could get another cab. 

When I contacted bolts the first time around I was told that the driver had completed the trip at the address I had it requested. When I tried to explain to Patrick that I was going to Bryant Road not Peckham rye he then told me according to his system I had went to Peckham Rye. I then explained I would not be making that payment as that‚Äôs not what the estimated figure was. 

I then got in contact with somebody else she was able to clarify there was an issue with the drivers GPS system, but I have asked for a refund and I have been told they do not issue a refund I‚Äôve asked where does it state this in the terms and conditions Paul is able to clarify where it states this in the terms and conditions. 

Paul has now replied back stating that on that night in question there was a surge charge applied to the that trip. I asked her why a message never pop up information me of a surge charge and why was this not stated in previous emails. Paul has come back to me offering me a coupon which gives me a discount on my next cab journey which I will not be excepting because I am disappointed with the way that I have been treated and don‚Äôt feel as if I can trust bolt. 

This is not the first time this has happened and I know several other people this has happened to so as a result of this I will no longer be using the services as they are worse than any other cab station.

1202,Nyendo changra,False,"I have a few complaints which i thought needed airing out.
1. My first time ever ordering a taxi, only for the driver to call me and tell me to cancel the trip since i was too far from his location so he couldn‚Äôt come

2. I ordered a bajaj, they asked me where i was going (which doesn‚Äôt makes sense since i‚Äôm sure he had the route figured, since that‚Äôs a requirement when you book, right? Place of pickup and destination?? I told him anyway, only for him to say that he can‚Äôt take me there because it‚Äôs too far.

3. Ordered taxis for my dad and mum (at different times and locations), sent price estimates to my dad/mum only for the final price being double the price of the estimated range.
-With my dad, he said that the driver had been getting lost a lot which i think they need to figure out the trip before this nuisance happening (unprofessional move) . Not only did he have to pay double the price, he was also late for his meeting

-with my mum, the driver kept suggesting ‚Äòanother route‚Äô from where my mum works to our home. A route that ended up costing *again* double the estimate price. My mum even advised the driver not to take the other route since she too drives and always takes a more straight ward route, but the driver kept insisting (for no good reason). I feel that the longer route was means to justify for the final price charged. 

Long story short: Taxify is meant to be a cheaper and more reliable alternative right? But i do think that the drivers are ruining it for the brand. 

They do say though, in swahili ‚Äòbure ghali‚Äô so i guess this is it :/",1,Drivers are ruining it for the company,2018-07-05 06:31:28
1203,asb-gb1,False,"Today, I booked a trip that had a wait time of 18 min, which was not feasible for me. I immediately cancelled the trip (well within the 4 min in the terms and conditions). The app displayed the Cancelling Trip screen. And I relaxed thinking there would be no further worry regarding this trip (who thinks of taking a screenshot for later proof??) 

However somehow the trip was not cancelled by Bolt and the driver was not notified. And I was charged a cancellation fee that was more costly than the actual ride would have been!

I called Bolt and they refused to refund me saying that under terms and conditions if the driver waits they have to be compensated and that there was no evidence I had cancelled. 

I am very disappointed. I need to be able to trust that the service I am using will take responsibility if it malfunctions. I need to be able to book in the confidence that if I respect the terms on my end, then the company will respect the terms on their end. I cancelled this trip using the correct procedures and within the correct timeframe. And the app confirmed this to me. The company‚Äôs service did not work appropriately and the driver had to wait. It is for the company to take responsibility and to compensate the driver. The booking process and system failed us both. 

If I cannot trust the service, and I am unfairly penalised or charged, I cannot use it. And I must recommend others don‚Äôt use it. I will prefer to use a service that values and protects its customers. And crucially sides with its customers rather than hiding behind excuses and vague terms. 

Bolt is cheap. Perhaps too cheap that it can afford to be honest... The key learning is you get what you pay for. I for one will be deleting the app. There are plenty of good alternatives out their that put the customer first. 

Bolt will have lost more with me than the ¬£8 for refunding an unfair charge.",1,Too cheap to be honest. You get what you pay for.,2020-09-29 09:21:15

1206,Dtzmnb,False,"I‚Äôve just had an issue when booking a ride for a female relative which has made me realise that this app is very unsafe. I have been working in the ground transport industry for 20 years so I know what I‚Äôm taking about, the fact this is my first ever review of any Travel app shows my concern. 
I booked a cab for a relative to take her home, roughly a 16 mile journey across central London. I was called by her an hour later telling me that the driver had taken a different route that has added an extra 1 hour to the joinery as they were now in Kent?! 
My complaint is not about the service of the driver but more aimed at BOLTS due-care and attention to passengers safety and well-being:
  I wasn‚Äôt worried about the money but extremely worried about the safety of a female relative being driven to a strange area without any real explanation. I decided to contact Bolt directly, I have been used to Uber and OLA dealing with any live service issues immediately especially if related to safety, Bolt on the other hand have made it impossible to contact them regarding an ongoing ride and simply have a link passing you onto the police for any safety related issue. If there is a way to contact, then you probably have to be some sort of computer coder to find it as trust me, I scanned the app and website for a good hour! 

THIS IS SUMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH and needs to be brought to the attention of TFL.  I am only writing this review as I‚Äôm totally fed up of billion dollar valued companies continuing to shirk their responsibilities and have no real dislike of Bolt, in fact I have been a supporter and user since their early days as taxify. I will now however have to discontinue using the app as I value the safety of my daughters and family members more than any discounted rides. 
Use at your own risk, drivers can do what they want, Bolt deal with issues retrospectively regardless of how serious. - This is extremely lazy and a dangerous operational process to implement. A real ticking time bomb.",1,Very scary app - No passenger safeguarding,2020-08-22 13:32:54
