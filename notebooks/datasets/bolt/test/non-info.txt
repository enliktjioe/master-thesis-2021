lenfour ratingtwo messing up big time!!!!!

lensix ratingfive it is the best laundiyabazi adds

lenfour ratingone your application is horrible.
lenfour ratingone you're a moron.
leneighteen ratingone there is not a single day that goes by that something doesn't go wrong with your program.
lenfour ratingone it's seriously absurd.
lennine ratingone again, to everyone else, do not download this application!!!!!
lenten ratingone you will have more problems than you can even imagine!!!!!!!
lenfifteen ratingthree the one for ipad is perfect though not as good as mypad , friended and friendcaster.
lenfive ratingthree however thanks for good effort
lenfive ratingtwo mobile site still works better.
leneight ratingone the website is fine but not the app.
lentwo ratingfour hridoy khan
lenten ratingthree this app now is more of a pleasure to use.
lennine ratingthree but seems recent updates are making the app worse!
lenfour ratingthree downgrading my star score
leneight ratingthree never had an issue on my droid charge.
leneight ratingone i've tried several times to download it.
lentwelve ratingtwo the facebook my phone comes with is way better then the update.
lentwelve ratingtwo how can a multi million dollar website have such a crappy app ?
lensix ratingone what is wrong with this app?
lensix ratingone on flipboard app everything is ok..
lensix ratingone native fb app just useless now...
lenfourteen ratingone i factory reset my phone so i could have the last version of facebook.
lenfive ratingfour could be si much better.
lensixteen ratingone before this update i could plz fix this i am getting very fed up with andriod
lenthree ratingfour easy banking experienc
lenfour ratingone this update is ridiculous.
lensixteen ratingone and what's even more ridiculous is the fact that they haven't fixed it yet.
lentwentynine ratingone you would think that after almost everyone gave a negitave review they would do something about it, but i guess they're too busy trying to get stock up.
leneight ratingone new update did not work on my phone..
lenfourteen ratingone i honestly wish i can down grade to the update before this one ugh!
lenseventeen ratingthree you may feel this app as a crap if you are using it for the first time.
lenseven ratingone this sucks i just use the browser
lenten ratingfive its good thet on android is fb  i love it <3<3
leneighteen ratingfive iam one of th somali ethiopians live in srs city jigjiga like every one to live peace & prograsive
leneight ratingone that's on a full 4g connection or wifi.
lenfive ratingone galaxy nexus 4g running jelly bean.
lenthirteen ratingfour i was skeptical thought that the update can't possibly be that bad .....
lentwo ratingone worst version.
lennine ratingtwo i thought zuckerberg was a better programmer than this
lenfourteen ratingone is it really that difficult to make and keep a fb application that works?
leneleven ratingone it seems like for every step forward they take two backwards.
lentwentyone ratingtwo will reevaluate once that's fixed as i hate using data when i have a hot spot right next to me.
lenfive ratingone please review and help user.
lenfive ratingfive smile and let others smile
lensix ratingone this version of facebook is sucks.
lensix ratingfour developers please work on problem soon......
leneight ratingfive fb is my newspaper.without facebook no lifebook
lenthirteen ratingone it was completely worthless, removed all updates and now it works fine again.
lenthirteen ratingone this has been a problem since day one of using this crap app...
leneleven ratingone if my laptop wasn't broke u would never use this.....
lentwelve ratingfive it is easy to use this app than searching for this website.
lenseven ratingfour so i think it shoud be updated...
lenfive ratingfour otherwise its a good app..
leneight ratingfive good thing i read the comments before updating ;))
lentwo ratingone app sucks.
lenfive ratingfour then you'll get 5 stars
lenfive ratingfive awsome app meets my expictations
lensixteen ratingone i don't know what is happening with this application,but it's working extremely bad!
leneleven ratingone why can't all facebook apps be in one application yet?
lensix ratingone no wonder everyone is leaving facebook.
lentwo ratingfive great apps
leneight ratingfour very helpful in staying connected with social friends
lentwentysix ratingone i swear when i first got my android phone several months ago, this fb app worked great,, but it seems with every update, it gets worse.
lenthirteen ratingone i have uninstalled, ide rather use fb on my internet browser then this!
lenfourteen ratingtwo no what i expected from an app with more thab a hundred million downloads..
lensix ratingtwo major bugs needs to be fixed..
lennine ratingone i wish i could uninstall this piece of crap
leneight ratingtwo this app is really starting to irritate me.
lenfour ratingtwo this app is horrible
lensix ratingfive can't live without this app
lensix ratingtwo it only works half the time...
lenthree ratingfive i love facebook.
lenten ratingfive i love the updates, the fast loading and so on.
lenfive ratingfive i'm mainly addicted lol..
lenten ratingone the new update has rendered this app useless to me.
lennine ratingthree new updates of fb app is not working correctly.
lenfifteen ratingone kill someone to make the others put more effort into this huge companies interface please?
leneight ratingone google+ might gain some ground after this one...
lennine ratingone just updated & still no better than before, terrible app.
lennine ratingone we deserve a much better app than this surely!!
leneleven ratingone this is rhe worst facebook ever, developers must be drug addics...
leneight ratingone new up grade just sucks plain an simple!!
lenthree ratingfive read the permissions!
lenfive ratingfive best social net work ever !
lenfifteen ratingone when @ first your phn is new,apps run great then after each update everything sucks.
leneight ratingone i avoid certain updates like fb n youtube.
lenthirteen ratingone i'd like to give you a big fat 0 for the latest update.
lensix ratingone 2/5 update: it just keeps getting worse!
lenfour ratingone you suck, app developers!!!
leneight ratingthree i have had to uninstall it 2 times already.
lensix ratingthree please try and fix it soon!
lenseven ratingfour day by day its bcoming the worst...
leneighteen ratingfour testing my patience like anything worst uploading of the homepage itself n god knows abt d other things.......
leneighteen ratingone i have to agree with many here, that the quality fo fb for android has drastically dropped recently.
lenthirtyone ratingone i believe that if fb wants to put out a good product out there for us the end user, they need to expand in their android development for all current devices.
lentwentynine ratingone i mean if they can develop consistent products, and this also applies to other social media they own, for apple then they should deliver the same quality for us!
lenfive ratingtwo worst update ever like wtf.
leneighteen ratingone i dont think im invisible bc my kids see me walking around the house sooooo what the heck?!?!?
lenseventeen ratingone i have seen many many many complaints on here about this same thing yet its still happening....
lenfourteen ratingone i'm thinking it would be pretty darn cool of u to fix this...
leneleven ratingone if i did my job this way, i'd be fired.
leneleven ratingone every time you update you create more problems than you fix.
lenfive ratingone this whole app is terrible.
lenfive ratingone apples app is far better.
lenthirteen ratingone maybe it's time to say bye bye facebook over this terrible app
lenten ratingone not at all impressed with these "upgrades" for smart phones.
lensix ratingfour use it everyday with my games!
lenthirteen ratingone how many complaints does there need to be before the problem gets fixed?
lensix ratingone fb randomly kicks the can again.
lenthree ratingfive need more modifications
lenfive ratingtwo im on gs3 with full 4g signal.
lennine ratingtwo has made everything sooo simple, light and faster :d
leneight ratingtwo [edit] reduced the number of stars from 5 to 2.
leneight ratingfour facebook mobile is really great social networking experience.
lennine ratingfour apart from a few bugs it's great overall.
lenfive ratingone gets worse with every update.
lenfive ratingone get your act together facebook.
lensix ratingtwo i hope fb can fix this.
lentwentyfive ratingtwo i have read a lot of the reviews and comments here and it seems like everyone with the samsung galaxy phones r having similar problems.
lentwentyone ratingone used to be great and work properly now its useless the mobile site is way faster so the app is pointless!!!
lentwentyone ratingthree apps with less devs and less funding can do a better job, facebook should be an industry standard of quality, but....
lenfive ratingtwo using htc sense to upload.
lentwo ratingone facebook app.
lenseven ratingone im gonna chech it on my browser.
lentwo ratingone total dissapointment!
lennine ratingone fix this app and i might download it again.
lenfour ratingfive awesome app be facebook
leneleven ratingone droid htc incredible 2 is what i'm running my app on.
lentwo ratingone absolutely awful!!
leneight ratingone with each "update" fb app just gets worse!!!
lenfive ratingone i will be un-installing.
lensixteen ratingone if i could give it 0 stars i would   leaving my old review \/ since the recent "upgrade"
leneight ratingone the entire app is now barely worth keeping.
lenthree ratingfive great app 5 stars :)
lenthirtytwo ratingtwo it's not working on my phone at all right i'm not going golfing browser facebook comes up a lot better please fix it used to work like a week ago
lennineteen ratingone i always have to go directly to the web on my laptop to do anything  facebook is messing up :(
lennine ratingone even stopping the app and reopening doesn't work.
lennine ratingone facebook still can't make an app for android.
lentwentytwo ratingfour much better uninstall the old app then re-install the new one than just update it by install over the old app
lensix ratingone every update makes the app worse...
leneight ratingfive best app after updating it become more faster.
lenfifteen ratingfour this app is very cool i used to have it and it worked great :d
leneleven ratingfour i had deleted the app & then decided to get it again.
leneleven ratingfour all of the sudden the app does not work,no more!
lenthree ratingtwo level up guys ..
lentwo ratingone pure garbage.
leneight ratingone shouldn't of even bothered making this app....
leneight ratingfive this app now can share things, chat express..
lentwelve ratingfive facebook is a great app ansd it become better after each update
lennine ratingfive i like it so people can contact each others
lentwo ratingone running terrible.
leneight ratingfive very good app i like it very much.
lenfour ratingfour ok till some extent
lenfifteen ratingone it must be pretty bad when there are almost half as many 1 stars as 5 stars...
lenthirteen ratingone and those 5 stars are probably really really old, back when everything worked fine....
lensix ratingone isn't that telling you something?
lentwelve ratingone i am going to uninstall until i read better reviews about upgrades.
lentwenty ratingone goodbye facebook app, hello facebook mobile website instead (for the times i actually even use facebook anymore which gets rarer)
lenfive ratingone it gets worse and worse.
lentwentyone ratingone i have this app because i need it for fast facebook access but i must say that i hate the app!
lenfour ratingone update the app asap!
lenthree ratingone this app sucks!!!!
lentwentyeight ratingone every time i update it it goes from ok to worse, then another update comes around and its a little better, then wham worse with the next update.
lentwelve ratingthree the touch screen on my phone works fine in every other aspect.
lenthirteen ratingtwo i've used this app on a galaxy s, s2 lte & now my note 2.
lenfive ratingtwo this is becoming very annoying.
leneleven ratingtwo please fix soon so i can rate this app with 5 stars.
lenten ratingthree how do i tag photo of myself from others picture?
lenthree ratingfive i love facebook
lenten ratingtwo i heared that zuckerberg is a die hard apple fan!!
lenthree ratingtwo maybe thats why!
lenthirteen ratingtwo very poor app, he can hire better developers and spare time and money..
lenfour ratingtwo jus use the browser..
lennine ratingtwo no matter how hard they try in the updates..
lenthree ratingtwo try harder zuck.
lensix ratingfour best app ever <3 especially for me .
lenfour ratingone worthless 98% of the time.
lenfive ratingone better off using your browser.
lentwelve ratingone it dont even work properly honested it plays up all the time
lennine ratingone i thought updates were supposed to be an improvement???
lenten ratingone you must kill it from a task manager or reboot.
lenseventeen ratingone you'd think the tinkerers @ fb would get something right here but this app is just annoying.
lenthree ratingone reduced to 1 star.
lentwo ratingthree great improvements
lensix ratingfour i love facebook more than anything
lensix ratingthree the second attempt usually works fine.
lentwenty ratingone it's pretty darn annoying and has forced me to use my computer instead, which of course means less fb.
lenseven ratingone seriously,  everytime facebook updates, it's worse!
lensix ratingtwo getting very aggravated after latest update.
leneight ratingfive iphone app is beastin this out the box!!
lenfifteen ratingfive since the updates, facebook for android has become, in my opinion, a much better app.
lenfifteen ratingfive it's easy to use, and you can now effectively see an 'offline news feed'!
lenthirtyseven ratingfive with simple-to-use features such as a 'pull down and release' mechanism to refresh the page, a swipe-out chat bar on the right and a swipe-out menu on the left, user friendliness is great!
lenfifteen ratingfive the app is quick to run, and doesn't consume battery life when running either!
leneleven ratingfive overall, a superbly updated app from the previous versions, very happy!
lensixteen ratingtwo i no longer am downloading updates for facebook they don't help or make it better
lensix ratingtwo very disappointed with the latest update.
leneleven ratingone i updated facebook and it wont work now please fix it
lensix ratingfour much better now, the latest update.
lenfive ratingtwo also feels clunky to use.
lenten ratingtwo meaning android task manager needs to step in to kill.
lenfourteen ratingtwo sent a report several times in the past, don't see this being fixed.
lenfour ratingtwo so moving to alternatives.
lenseven ratingone i thought the updates supposed to help.
lenten ratingone a lot of my friends are having trouble as well.
lenten ratingtwo is anyone else having this problem or have a solution?
leneight ratingtwo i've even uninstalled and reinstalled the app.
leneleven ratingone app is beyond a joke, every update makes the app worse
leneleven ratingthree network is fine, it works for every other app i have. .
lentwentyone ratingone i have had enough of your nagging and insinuations that i am a lonely man in need of more online companionship.
lennine ratingtwo never updates,  easier to use web browser, not happy!
lenseven ratingtwo would recommend just using browser for now.
lenseven ratingone google+ for mobile is so much better.
lensix ratingone because they listen to there users.
lentwelve ratingone i had this working on my phone until a few days ago.
lenfourteen ratingone for god's sake, fix this otherwise i'll just not be using facebook!
lenseven ratingthree was so glad to have this app...
lenfourteen ratingthree im a facebook junkie but ever since the last update i've been screwed...
lennine ratingthree so annoyed, i'm afraid to update anything now...
lensix ratingone i don't dance that dance!
lensix ratingthree since new update its playing up!!!
lennine ratingfour it takes longer time to update make it fast...!!!
lenthree ratingfive love this app..
leneight ratingthree i really like itbest facebook app upgrade yet.
lenseven ratingthree especially since i hated the last one !!!
lennine ratingtwo i have verizon 4g with the droid razer max hd.
lenfifteen ratingtwo the phone and network are extremely fast for every other app and the internet browser.
lenfive ratingone the app itself works fine.
lenseven ratingone fb update i hate the new update..
leneight ratingone i sure hope they figure this out fast.
lennine ratingfive amaizing software it works fast i like this one
lenseven ratingone everytime they updates it it get worse.
lenthree ratingone doesnt work, crap!
lenfour ratingone facebook, your app sucks!
lenfour ratingone you suck donkey balls!!!
lenfourteen ratingone i see the iphone application has a terrible following, at least you're consistent.
lentwelve ratingone nobody needs it to look pretty, how about getting it functional first.
lenfour ratingfour buy pretty well satisfied
lennine ratingone the team really needs to pick up their feet.
lentwentythree ratingone it's almost better just to go to the website directly from my mobile web browser then it is to use the app.
lennine ratingone it doesn't matter if i have 3g, 4g or wifi!
lenfive ratingfour feel great to have it!
lensixteen ratingone instead of faffing around adding things that aren't needed sort all the other issues out.
lenten ratingone why do you have to complicate things all the time.
lenfive ratingone very very bad user experience.
lenfive ratingone dead useless since latest update.
lennine ratingone don't want or need what they've added.
leneleven ratingone the app was working fine, until two or three updates ago.
leneighteen ratingone why is there a rating section if they don't even look at it and fix the problems?
lentwo ratingone bad performance
leneighteen ratingone dear facebook devs, could you please drop your iphones for a while and take care of android platform!
lenfourteen ratingone r u guys ever gonna fix all the problems with this app or what???
lenthree ratingfour finally native app
lenfour ratingone app sucks any more..
lenfifteen ratingone it will run great then u add a upgrade and then it runs like crap
lennine ratingone its cool this app performing view equal to pc.
lentwentyone ratingfive the way facebook app and mobile site seems to be decreasing in workmanship, facebook owners must not care about facebook users.
lenseven ratingfive it's like they are joking around.
lenseven ratingfive i remember when the app did work.
lenthree ratingone what happened facebook?
lenseventeen ratingone if i go to the same status but opening directly from my timeline, the comment posts ok.
lentwo ratingone proper annoying!
lenfour ratingone updates are for improving!
leneighteen ratingone over 1 million one star reviews - the worst in the market (& one of the most invasive) & still going downhill.
lensix ratingone i do not trust this app.
leneighteen ratingone this app's only plus is that it gives you a *glimpse* of your facebook feed, at best.
lenthirteen ratingone other than that, the app fails on delivering any sort of reliable functionality.
lenten ratingone completely unacceptable from such a large company such as facebook.
lensix ratingthree still a bit buggy at times
lenfive ratingfour simply most useful app around!
lenfourteen ratingtwo with every update they seem to solve bugs there's always a new issue
lensix ratingone i want a low maintenance app.
lentwo ratingone app sucks
lenthree ratingthree need some improvement
lennine ratingfive i love this app and use it every day
lenfive ratingone this app sucks for android.
lenten ratingone when i use it on my iphone , its near instant.
lenfour ratingone i expected something better.
lentwelve ratingone i have an ipad and it is as instant as my iphone.
lenten ratingone im giving you a chance and so far, you failed .
leneighteen ratingone are we ever going to get an update where things are going great for longer than several weeks?
lenfour ratingone each upgrade gets worse.
lenseven ratingone i just use mobile web based now.
lensix ratingone for the love of god fb.
leneleven ratingone it worked ok for me until i got the latest update.
leneleven ratingone seems they took a buggy app and introduced even more bugs.
lenseven ratingone if it isnt fixed soon im uninstalling.
lenseven ratingone un-install and the phone runs perfectly!
lensix ratingfive its very fast with voice messages
lensixteen ratingone as convenient as it is to have this on my phone, it's just as annoying.
lenthree ratingone unuseable its nonfunctioning
lenfive ratingthree facebook fans download it now!!!!!!!!!!
leneight ratingone i'm on 4g and wi-fi, no excuses...
lenfive ratingtwo the most recent update sucks.
leneight ratingone i have to uninstall and reinstall every 2 days.
leneleven ratingtwo after years of development the app is still full of bugs.
lensixteen ratingtwo instead of adding more features why do you try and get the basic features functional first.
lensix ratingone no, facebook, no. stop asking me.
lensix ratingone my granny is faster than rubbish !!!
lensix ratingone it is a useless junk application!
lenfive ratingone did u know updating means???
lensixteen ratingone i gave 1 star coz i took it for free, but it is better to be uninstalled.
leneight ratingone recent updates have made this app completely useless.
lentwelve ratingone an app from a publicly traded company should perform much much better.
lenten ratingone when this app was, you know, simple, it was great.
lenseven ratingone i'm deleting it from my phone.
leneight ratingone g+ and twitter from now on i guess.
lennineteen ratingthree always stop for no reason an when i try to report it will not let me y is that
lennine ratingone the android version of the facebook app is terrible!
lentwo ratingtwo samsung charge.
lensix ratingone please fix this piece of crap!
lentwentythree ratingone facebook for iphone /ipod gets a new update like every week why is it so hard to do a good update for android????
leneight ratingtwo i love the pop up window for comments.
leneight ratingtwo i wish the other issues would be fixed
lensix ratingone nice work on the image previews.
lenseven ratingone this app works properly 5-10% if the time.
lennine ratingfive it is nice and easy to contact my friends.
lenseven ratingone this app sucks plz update it soon ...
lenfour ratingone i am using 3g connection ...
leneleven ratingone i wil give it 5 star rating if it solves these problems
lennine ratingone this crap just seems to get worse and worse.
leneight ratingone thanks facebook for your censorship and horrible app
lenfive ratingtwo facebook needs some major work!
lenfive ratingfive after updating facing several issues.
lenseven ratingfive and many more so finally uninstalled it.
lensix ratingfive opera is working beter than this.
lentwo ratingfive nice job
leneleven ratingone i've waited, reported & am going to uninstall this useless app.
lensix ratingfive why i didnt use my facebook...
lensix ratingfive i install many times i think...
lennineteen ratingfour since most user used this app, add some report page button also, some fp just threaten another country, etc
leneleven ratingfive i've been using facebook since 2008, the fb developed so much!
lensixteen ratingfive and i hope it would be the top 1 again in the play store top free category! :))
lentwo ratingfive cool interface!!!!!!!!
lenthree ratingfive better features please
lenseven ratingfive very useful update for my htc desire.
leneleven ratingtwo this app should be called ice powered by ms windows me.
lennine ratingtwo so usually if its only a really quick poop.
lenten ratingtwo its good but needs to be a lil more upgraded
lensix ratingone this app has many frustrating bugs.
lenfourteen ratingone im reinstalling to see if this whack app fixes itself, new phone motorola electrify.
lentwo ratingone poor development!!!
lenfour ratingfour who dont like fb???
lenten ratingone i have deleted and reinstalled the fb app 4 times now.

lentwo ratingfour nice app
lentwo ratingfive love fb
leneleven ratingone cant blame my phone g3 works great with all my other apps
leneight ratingone i am bored to send all time reports.
lennine ratingone does the exact opposite of what this app says :/....
lenfour ratingone the worst app ever!
lenthirteen ratingone either updaye and fix the bugs or downgrade back to the last version!!!
lentwo ratingone samsung infuse
lenseven ratingthree everything was good till this last update....
lenten ratingone facebook team really the worst & most dumbfuck developer ever exist!!!
lentwelve ratingone this app need to be flagged as shi7 & remove it from playstore forever.
lenfour ratingone always screwing with android.
leneight ratingtwo pretty much every other time i open it.
lenseven ratingone please fix all these annoying bugs immediately!!!
lenfive ratingone wish i could remove update.

lensix ratingone the facebook apps are getting worse!
lenfourteen ratingone the original app was the best but thats never good enough for you people!
lentwo ratingthree wats hpning?
lenthree ratingtwo newest update sucks!!
leneight ratingone the app worked just fine before it "updated"
lenfour ratingone new update screwed it!
lentwentyfive ratingone you'd think with this being an app that has so many complaints it would fix them instead of adding new stuff to the app??
lenfourteen ratingthree i have to use foursquare if i want to check into a new place.
lenthree ratingone deleting this trash.
lenfour ratingone you have 24 hrs facebook.
lenthree ratingfive good socail media
lenseven ratingtwo it was faster before the last update.

lennine ratingone worse than the old app & that was bad enough!
lensix ratingone seriously don't bother with it!

lenten ratingone it's supposed to be helpful but it's not
lenthree ratingone this app sucks.
leneight ratingone what's the point of the crap updates?
leneight ratingone the other version was working fine for me.
leneight ratingtwo takes forever to update or to do anything.
lennineteen ratingone lol i've quit installing the updates because it seems when they fix one thing two more problems appear...
lenthree ratingone sucks a lot
lennine ratingone its not even my internet as webpages are fine!

lenfive ratingone was great til latest update.
lennine ratingone but can if i go on the web browser.
lentwentythree ratingone that needs sorting, it's not my phone or connection as i use other apps all the time including sat nav without problem.
lentwentythree ratingfour if you can't see any pictures or are having other issues try uninstalling then installing the app, and then restart your phone.
lentwo ratingfive super app
lensix ratingtwo you'll need to update asap!
lenten ratingtwo can't this app go one day without any problems?

lensixteen ratingone i hate android facebook app its annoying too much they should update it plz 1 star only
lenfive ratingthree posts via facebook for android
lentwo ratingone sooooooooooooo stupid
lenthree ratingthree nt so cool..
lenseven ratingone facebook was fine before the lattest update!!
lenfour ratingtwo i shouldnt have upgraded.
lenten ratingone seems facebook keeps spinning it's wheels trying to update.
lentwelve ratingthree i loved the new update but this latest update messed it up.
lennine ratingone i have tried uninstalling & installing again but still nothing.
lenfive ratingfive awsme app,,, i love it,,, :)
lenthirteen ratingtwo it was awful before the updates by knockin me out of the app.
lenfour ratingtwo it keeps getting worse.
lentwelve ratingone i hope you can make the app just like the ios version.
lenseventeen ratingone it's more reliable to use facebook in the web browser of the phone than the app.
lenthree ratingone sucks soooo much!
lenten ratingone the update before the recent one was so much better!
lensix ratingone this is the worst app ever!
leneleven ratingone i seriously used it for a month and it stoped working
lensix ratingfive the updates to facebook are improving..
lenfour ratingfive facebook definitely gets 5 stars!
lensix ratingone gets worse with every update thanks :-/
lenfive ratingone all the time, hate that!!!
lennine ratingfour sucks tried getting rid of if it horrible app
lennineteen ratingtwo i think this is why words with friends won't work anymore either since it ties into facebook friends.
lentwelve ratingone for such a high quality site, your app is very poor quality.
lentwentythree ratingfour now if i plan to write a long-ish post, i type it in my notepad app, and cut&paste it into facecbook.
lennineteen ratingfour this is very annoying, please fix this (i'm using s3, don't know if the bug is phone-specific).
lensix ratingfour otherwise i'd give it 5 stars.
lensix ratingfour not critical, but would be handy.
lentwentyfour ratingone not only is this annoying but it is very frustrating when i'm trying to talk to my husband who is deployed in afghanistan.
lensixteen ratingone facebook is our main source of communication when he gets some (not often) time to talk.
lenfive ratingtwo it becomes worse than previously
lentwelve ratingone this app is the worst, i ever seen on a samsung phone.
leneight ratingthree it's not the best app for facebook.
lenfive ratingthree their mobile site loads better.
lenthirty ratingthree i don't know if it's just because i have an older phone, or if it's their app, but either way, the other social media apps work better.
lenfour ratingone the newest update sucks...
lenfive ratingone app fails all the time
lennineteen ratingone there are way too many problems with this app for me to recommend anyone to install one there device.
lenfive ratingone needs to improve, otherwise 5star app
lenfour ratingone this app sucks bad.
lennine ratingone i use the internet instead most of the time.
lenfifteen ratingtwo its so irritating i don't even like to use it like i used to.
lensix ratingthree 5 stars if these issues are resolved!
lennine ratingfive its the best in convenece but needs an update
lentwo ratingone fuckin sucks...
leneight ratingtwo i have to constantly remind me of that
lentwelve ratingone if i didn't move across country i would delete this app...
lenthirteen ratingone it's been like this for 3 updates now seriously this is getting old.
lenten ratingone if i knew more people with google + i would switch.
lenseven ratingone this deserved rating in negative if possible
leneleven ratingone you guys really need to get it together for fb mobile.
lenfour ratingone it keeps getting worse.
lenfourteen ratingone some of the screw ups that i can even remember, there's so many...
lenthree ratingthree but need improvement
lennine ratingthree the older version of this app is much better. :(
leneight ratingone more than a month now without the app.
lenfive ratingone will not update or install.
lenfive ratingone despite having full lte signal.
lenthirty ratingtwo every time i see there's an update for facebook i just know there's a chance of decreased quality in the app but this last one was especially horrible.
leneight ratingtwo they really screwed the pooch on this app.
lenseven ratingone getting worse each day after last update.
lensix ratingone i have to restart app often.
lenten ratingone this app is now total and utter piece of crap.
lenthree ratingthree verry good software
lenfour ratingone i hate this app...
lenten ratingtwo i don't uderstand why you people not doing anything.
lenthree ratingone makes me sad.
leneight ratingone please fix this then dont do anymore updates!!!!
lenfifteen ratingone please update it very soon earlier update was much much faster than the latest update.
lenfour ratingfive facebook is da best
lensixteen ratingone if you want your memory taken over by just one app then this is for you.
leneleven ratingone soon the only operating app is going to be just this.
leneleven ratingfive i like this app very much but it could use chat
lenfive ratingone becoming worse after every update.
lenten ratingone i uninstalled and now i use messenger and opera browser.
lennine ratingone why is messenger getting better and facebook becoming worse?
lenfour ratingfive suck after update it...
lenfourteen ratingone if you are looking at updating this app i sincerely hope you don't.
lenfour ratingone worst app update ever.
leneight ratingone used to have a 5 star rating from me
lensix ratingfour fb should pay attentions for that
lentwo ratingfive awsum app...?
leneleven ratingone dont really like using facebook mobile but at least its reliable.
lensix ratingone always used for higher level mobiles.
lentwentysix ratingtwo i have the samsung galaxy exhilerate, which is a very fast phone so i know its not because of that, i'm also running jelly bean.
lenfour ratingfive very nice one lool
lenfour ratingone is completely a crap.
lentwelve ratingone due seems like nobody at facebook tests properly for the real world.
lenten ratingone its almost like they assume facebook is the only app.
lenseventeen ratingone i've not exploited google's yet, but facebook is starting to push us users that way.
leneight ratingone wake up facebook, start developing apps like grownups.
lennineteen ratingone hassling out crap app updates is going to be your demise if you don't get your act together.
lensix ratingfour shuts off some times but good
leneight ratingone the app is a streaming pile of crap.
lentwelve ratingone always has been, and i don't expect better in the future.
lenthree ratingone very poor app
lenten ratingfive fb is always a bigest addiction to all nd me 2...
lenthree ratingone updates always suck -.-"
lensix ratingone never using fb on phone again.
lenfive ratingtwo gets worse with every update...
lentwo ratingtwo becoming useless...
lenfifteen ratingone so i'm rating it 1 because it is the only possible rating i could give
lenfour ratingone really poor, buggy app.
lenthirteen ratingone using the website is a lot quicker and i can actually post things.
leneight ratingone samsung stratosphere the app won't even work.
lenfour ratingone your app sucks, schmuckerberg.
leneighteen ratingone i have a motorola electrify and facebook will not allow any facebook apps to function on my phone..
lenfourteen ratingone so i'm paying the price for these electronic moguls to feed their fued..
lentwentyone ratingone what wrong with facebook app on android since there was nothing wrong with ios facebook app in my iphone before this..
lenfourteen ratingone i am always going toy browser to reply back, too much waste of time..
lentwo ratingone app deleted.
lennine ratingone so stop tampering with something that worked perfectly well
lennine ratingone after the update it's not working any more.
lenfive ratingfive i wan't update it.
lenfour ratingfive no need to comment........
lenfour ratingone seriously, what happened dude?
lensix ratingtwo not thrilled with the new version.
lennineteen ratingthree have you actually seen the facebook appstore app please try to put the android app up to that standard .........
lensix ratingone getting annoyed with the new update
lensix ratingone previous updates were a lot better!
lenten ratingone much much easier to use facebook through the browser now :(
lenthree ratingtwo galaxy siii user!
lensix ratingfive open facebook faster and photos also
lentwelve ratingone i have samsung s2 n my friend who has s3 has the same issue.
lenfive ratingone is fb boycutting samsung phones?!
lenten ratingone i realized most samsung users have problems on this app.
lenfifteen ratingthree this app needs to be a lot more vanilla instead of jam-packed with bloatware.
lenthree ratingone just plain terrible
lenten ratingone it used to be better before i allowed the update.
lenthree ratingone worthless to download
lenseven ratingone i like the old one way better.
lentwo ratingone horrible app!!
leneleven ratingone i rarely leave bads reviews, but this app has earned it.
lensix ratingone this fb app for android stinks!
lenfive ratingone many more cons than pros.
lenfour ratingtwo i like this application.
lenseven ratingtwo but i want my update via samsung.
lennine ratingfive facebook is the best red social of the world
lenfive ratingfive installed and it works fine
lenseven ratingone fix whatever went wrong with this update!

lenfourteen ratingfive i like facebook everyone has one so i decided to make my facebook page
lentwelve ratingtwo its really good im able to connect with my friends more easily
leneight ratingone please fix this then dont do anymore updates!!!!
lenfourteen ratingtwo it acts up too much if they fixed it i would rate it 5 stars
lenthree ratingfive easy facebook access
lentwelve ratingthree had to go back to the factory version for the time being.
lennine ratingthree did not have this problem until last couple updates.
lenfour ratingone my connection is okay.
lenthree ratingone time to update!
lenfive ratingone sick of pls fix it!!!!
lenten ratingone its sad when the browser works better than the app.
leneight ratingone clearly, it has a flaw along those lines.
lenthirteen ratingtwo makes me not like my phone sometimes but it's clearly the app.
lenfive ratingthree actual improvements would be nice.
lenseven ratingtwo it sucks but i've seen worse.
lenfifteen ratingtwo facebook has a lot of work to do though and they better do it asap.
lensix ratingone removed it and using just browser
lenfive ratingfour then i'll give 5 star...
lentwelve ratingone i don't like how every time i go on the app.
lenthirteen ratingone the non-app version doesn't have all the crap in the stream.
leneleven ratingone i get social, but where is my option to opt out.
lenfive ratingfive best facebook app for chat
lensixteen ratingone i had to uninstall your app then reinstall it by updating to get it to work.
lensix ratingone please your updating screws it up.
lenten ratingone so from now on i will not allow automatic updating.
lenseven ratingone i will manually update the app myself.
lenseven ratingone still no stars over one, for rating!
lennine ratingfour works really well on my android razor love it
lenthirteen ratingthree i have to go to the internet on my phone amd do it.
lentwelve ratingone ive uninstalled and reinstalled expecting something different but getting the same results.
lensix ratingone just call me and this "insane!"
leneight ratingone how can i enjoy fb with these issues???
lentwenty ratingfive what is totally awesome because blackies are the ask i need to use cut my friends and stuff my facebook.
lennine ratingtwo all aspects of the app are spotty at best.
lenseven ratingtwo using web browser to surf facebook now.
lenfour ratingfour i love the app!
lenseven ratingtwo have reported numerous times with no fix.
lennine ratingone my facebook was working good in till my update.
lenfour ratingone amazing app love it <3
lenfour ratingone lots of errors problems!
lentwelve ratingthree it hardly ever works, and i'd love to see it fixed.
leneight ratingone i am sooo in agreement with paul rowland!
lenseventeen ratingone i can't tell u how upsetting it is to see an app that has over 100,000,000 users
lennine ratingone have uninstalled multiple times and updated, but nothing helps.
lentwentytwo ratingfive it isn't compatible with rootbox rom on android 4.2 on the market, but i searched the web and it installed just fine
lentwentyone ratingone is it that hard being a massive coporation to listen to your users and make an app that f*cking works!
lentwo ratingfive fb forever
lennine ratingone no, i don't want to find new friends
lenseven ratingthree why isn't this feature working properly?
lentwo ratingthree pretty annoying.
lenseven ratingone the browser works better than the app....
lenfour ratingone i uninstalled this app
lenfive ratingone pls fix for motorola xt-502.
leneleven ratingfour this app is not so bad as people's reviews say ...
lenthirtynine ratingfour i have not updated it since a very old version b/c of the reviews but when i did i liked it its ok a lot faster than old version not so much lags for my way of using
lennineteen ratingone just removed update and back to build in version (old 1 year i think) and now every thing is smooth.
lenfive ratingone so 0 stars for new update
lensixteen ratingone i realize this is a free app but how difficult is it to make it work.
lenfourteen ratingone friendcaster is free too and that's what i'm using from now on.
lenthree ratingone your app sucks.
lentwo ratingone simply ridiculous.
lenthree ratingone really bad app.
lentwo ratingone getting worse.
lenfive ratingone completely foolish and uninituative app...
lenthree ratingfive awesome basically awesome
lentwo ratingfive awesome app..

lennine ratingfive i love being able 2 catch up wiv my frends.
lenfour ratingfive facebook is my world
lennine ratingone i dont use facebook therfore i dont want it.
lenthree ratingone very poor app!
lentwo ratingone basically useless!
lenseven ratingone i don't really like using it.
lenten ratingone the app makes me think facebook is even more overrated.
lensix ratingone it should've never gone public.
lenthirteen ratingone each update gets worse and worse, even if i uninstall and then reinstall.
lennine ratingone please fix this asap, starting to get really annoying.
lennine ratingone can not get on facebook where is some help.
lenthree ratingfive sister loves it
lenfive ratingtwo tired of all the errors!
leneleven ratingthree my mobile is low range one it troubleing to this app
lenfourteen ratingfive i have installed and unistalled for many times but still having the same problem..
lennineteen ratingfour keep it up, inspite of encountering major or minor bugs i consider you as a champion of social network
lenfourteen ratingone facebook is worth so much money, but cannot even make an app that works.
lenthree ratingone samsung galaxy iii
lenseven ratingtwo itd be great if youd fix this.
lenseventeen ratingone i recently bought a samsung galaxy tab 10 inch, and i also have had the 7 inch galaxy tab.
lentwenty ratingone the facebook app would work great on the 7 inch, but since the latest update, it has not been working properly.
lennine ratingone fix these issues, and give us another, better update!
lenseventeen ratingone on top of all of that, i can't even give a review for the facebook app.
lentwentytwo ratingone lol it is as if you know you're going to get a negative review, so you block those reviews from posting.
lennine ratingone i just decided to go with the browser instead.
lentwo ratingthree ittss okayyy !
lenfive ratingfive carolene sears loves her facebook
lennine ratingfour still could use polishing but very updated for android
leneight ratingthree reception, in general, has never been great either.
leneight ratingthree any suggestions as to what i might try?
lennineteen ratingthree the constant 'upgrades' seem to be mostly backward motions and make it more difficult rather than easier or better.
lennine ratingone the last update screwed it up on my phone!
lenfour ratingone this update seriously sucks.
leneight ratingthree when i know  i got an internet connection.
lentwelve ratingthree working better than the previous version but not so fast or cool.
lennineteen ratingone fb app hasnt been the same in a long time, i see im not the only 1 having this problem.
lentwentysix ratingone after the last update i'm about ready for facebook to buy me a new phone because i'm going to throw mine against a wall.
lenfifteen ratingone its so annoying, you're better of just using the internet over this stupid app!
lenseventeen ratingone if you had a competitor, i would take all 400+ of my multi-national friends away with me.
lenfive ratingone this app is fucked up.
lenfour ratingfive indeed an awesome app!
lenseven ratingfive faster too but only wid a 3g connection!
lenthree ratingfour thank you developers!
leneight ratingone the worst facebook app i have ever used.
leneleven ratingone when i know for a fact that my network is available....
lensix ratingone this app just keeps getting worse..
lensix ratingone even on my amazing phone/wifi.
leneight ratingone and my wifi works great on other apps.
lenfive ratingone so definitely not my connection.
lenthree ratingone uninstalling, til fixed!
lenfifteen ratingone i'm over having to uninstall and reinstall it, i'm just deleting it now.
leneight ratingone get your act  together facebook, it's annoying!!!
lenthree ratingone terrible at updating.
lenten ratingone please, just this, anything else i could care less about!
leneleven ratingone junk is all i can say won't work at all

lensixteen ratingtwo i go on from computer it is there was much better before you started changing it!
lenseven ratingone the update messed up the whole app.
lennine ratingone what take you guys so long to fix it.
leneleven ratingone i'm tired of waiting for you guys to fix it.
lenfour ratingone worked fine before update
lenthree ratingfive loads alot better.
lenfour ratingfive just few minor bugs.
leneight ratingone fix it so i can actually use fb!!
lenfour ratingone need i say more.
lenseven ratingthree overall, the app is good to use.
lenfour ratingfive is a great app
lenten ratingone had to uninstall and reinstall app a few times recently.
lennine ratingfour i've looked around, but can't find it.
lennine ratingfour has this moved, or is it no longer available?
lentwelve ratingone it does not matter if it's a free service or not.
lenten ratingone you really don't care about us as the consumer.
lenfourteen ratingone i personally have reported issues and my issues match alot of other people's.
leneighteen ratingone so that to me shows you obviously dont care, otherwise the issues would have been corrected by now.
lenfive ratingfive im using xperia neo ics.
lenfive ratingfive i like the new features!
lentwelve ratingone stupid that they haven't fixed this yet, after sending multiple reports...
lensix ratingone i have tried redl and everything.

lenseven ratingone wtf have you done to this app?
lenfifteen ratingtwo i've contacted developer many times about problems with the last update, with no reply.
lennine ratingone please fix, this used to be my favorite app.
lenfourteen ratingtwo it is the app not my phone as google+ and other apps work perfect.
lenseven ratingone ever since i updated the last time ..
lentwelve ratingone the only thing i see is people's names & what they post.
lenfive ratingfour it is very nice app
lenfour ratingone this is getting ridiculous.
leneighteen ratingone you all seriously need to work out these kinks in the system or i may just drop facebook.
lenthree ratingone this app sucks.
lentwo ratingfive love fb
lenfour ratingfive best apps in india
lenfive ratingfive it was a simple application...
lentwo ratingthree 1 step improvement..
lenfourteen ratingone my internet is working great for everything except for this app please fix this
lensixteen ratingone is 1 of the worst apps on my phone, hard to believe considering how popular facebook is
leneight ratingone making this kind of app this is embarrasing...:(
lenthirteen ratingone updating apps should improve performance and make you want to use it more.
lennine ratingone this facebook app is terrible and constantly has problems :/
lentwentytwo ratingfour would just like to give some feedback to the developers on bugs for fixing when using this app with a galaxy y: 1.
lenfour ratingfive its facebook lol ssdd
lennine ratingfive i will change my mind if its not guud
lensixteen ratingtwo an improvement on the last incarnation i like the share option and the slightly improved animations.
lenseven ratingtwo this it's my third time reinstalling....
lenseven ratingone can't wait for an updated version.
lenseven ratingone this is the worse version so far!
lenten ratingfour could do with fixing really but there not massive issues.
