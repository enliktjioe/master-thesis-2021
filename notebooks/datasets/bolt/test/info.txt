lenthirteen ratingfour even if i click on the picture itself it still won't load.
lensixteen ratingone i will bump it up to 5 stars when they can move it to my sd card!!!
lenfifteen ratingfour it just needs something like you get to go offline and just read news feeds
lentwentytwo ratingone it keeps force closing the only reason i still have the app is because its just a little faster than the internet

leneight ratingtwo i can never upload photos using this app.
lentwenty ratingtwo the progress bar is always 0% with no title, and i can't make it go away without restarting my phone.
lenfive ratingthree tired of it forcing close
leneleven ratingtwo this app takes up way too much memory on my phone.
lensix ratingtwo keeps force closing all the time
lenthirteen ratingone slow to load n forces close htc hero, great if u run orig.
lentwentyone ratingone i told you that a dozen times already but thanks for the constant popup notification that can't be disabled ever.
lenfive ratingone still no sd card option.
lensix ratingone takes up way too much space.
lenthree ratingfour feed is delayed...
lenfour ratingone stupid app keep refreshing
lennine ratingone force closes constantly, will not let me view comments.
lentwentytwo ratingone my app has not worked right, the way i comment on anything/everything has been down graded and is not user friendly.
leneight ratingone my phone is fritzing out since the upgrade.
lentwentythree ratingtwo i've always used facebook movie mobile, but lately i've been having problems with my timeline not refreshing with the current update.
lensixteen ratingtwo it always reads "network error." this also has affected applications that i have connected to facebook.
lensixteen ratingfour when i open a picture in this app, it irritates me by opening previously opened picture ...
lenfortyfour ratingone this app is so slow will not add my pics most of the time and crashes my phone alot i uninstall and re install allot but the next time i uninstall thats it not getting back on if i could i would give 0 stars
lenthree ratingone constantly force closes.
leneight ratingone freezes, won't let me check in anywhere
lenthirteen ratingone my status won't ever upload and i can't tag any one....
lenfive ratingthree it should have multi tabs ...
lensixteen ratingone won't load anything when connected to wifi then it started not loading anything at all.
leneight ratingtwo it's so painful when login facebook now.....
lenfive ratingtwo loading everything is so slooooooow.
leneighteen ratingtwo this application was great before the last update, when i open a pic it opens a different pic.
lennine ratingthree since the last update i cant post any status...
lenfifteen ratingthree for me to be able to post a status, i need to open a browser..
lentwentyone ratingtwo i use my phone almost  exclusivly to log into fb and not being able to delete or edit comments is unacceptable
lenthree ratingone doesnt load pictures.
lenfour ratingthree keeps on force closing!!
lenthirteen ratingtwo always force closes when i try to log in to games thru facebook.
lenseventeen ratingone i get a forceclose every other time i open facebook now and it's driving me nuts...
leneighteen ratingone then when i reopen it, it takes minutes to load everything and the pictures take about 5 minutes longer.
leneleven ratingone fix this thing, no network error , the app es near useless
lenten ratingtwo i can't get any pics in the news feed.
lennine ratingone each update becomes increasingly intrusive into your personal life.
lensix ratingone can't turn off location tracking...
leneighteen ratingone so sick and tired of getting network error messages when at the same time, facebook web works fine!
lentwentyfive ratingone i always have to close the app from my multi-tasking so that the next time i open it, it will hopefully load my newsfeed.
lenseven ratingthree pictures and new stories load pretty slowly.
lenten ratingthree my biggest pet peeve is that i can't "like"
lenfifteen ratingthree things 95% of the time, or it takes five or six taps to register the "like."
lenseven ratingthree notifications frequently take me to something irrelevant.
lenseven ratingthree this is constantly having problems loading comments.
lenfifteen ratingthree i can almost never get them to show on pictures, status updates or anything else.
lenten ratingone has anyone else been having issues with constant force close?
lensix ratingone can't post since last update.
lennineteen ratingone also, they need to make it so that you can hide posts from certain people like the website does.
lennineteen ratingtwo the app is good & all, but some images in my news feed can only be previewed instead of opened.
lenfifteen ratingtwo occasionally, the app says that the image can't be opened & please try again later.
lenfour ratingone move to sd please
lenfive ratingone news feed shows no pics...
lenseventeen ratingthree the only thing about the newer app i hate is the "like" and "comment" feature is broken.
lensixteen ratingone i have installed and  uninstalled this several time to get an up to date time line....
lenten ratingone slow, rarely loads anything - pages, photos, comments - nothing, constantly crashes.
lentwentysix ratingone i can't change my covert photo from my phone,  searching for anything is awful, i have to type , then delete, then retype, then it works.
lentwelve ratingone loading pics and comments take much longer, i.don't like it.
lenfive ratingone serious bug dealing with notifications.
lentwenty ratingone opening app from a notification after its been running in the background for a while results in endless wait loop.
leneleven ratingone never shuts down in the background and has no exit button.
lensixteen ratingone reinstalled to get the share link back bit the churning following a notification is still awful.
lensix ratingthree still has issues with check-ins. :|
lentwentythree ratingthree after the latest update, i have not been able to post status updates on the first try, even with strong 4g data or wifi.
lenten ratingthree generally speaking, the app seems much slower than previous versions.
lenten ratingthree i see "unable to establish a secure connection" errors often.
lenthirtyfive ratingthree also it refreshes while i'm trying to read updates in my news feed and seems me to top of news feed page so i have to scroll and search for what i was reading.
leneleven ratingone facebook crashes at least three times a day on my galaxy s2.
leneight ratingone i constantly clear data, but it still crashes...
lentwentyfive ratingthree cant post photos to certain albums, cant delete comments & sometimes when i try uploading photos, they say 'error and photo cannot be uploaded' or somethin :/
lenten ratingone now it won't even load, just keeps saying error.
lenseven ratingtwo doesn't update correctly, freezes a lot.
lennineteen ratingtwo needs fixed, doesn't show the comments or when i chose to look at pictures it doesn't load.
lenseven ratingone will not load this sucks try again :(""
lenfourteen ratingthree most recent didn't really show most recent feed, it still show top story.
lensix ratingthree scrolling lag from time to time.
lenfive ratingtwo slow loading after last update...
leneight ratingtwo rarely refreshes news feed on the first try.
leneight ratingone only shows up to 98 likes on a photo
lennine ratingtwo i wish we could save pics from this app
lensixteen ratingtwo does everything you would expect, still needs some work on the approvals for privacy confirmation process.
lenseventeen ratingtwo but the major issue i have is some background task is grinding my phone to a halt.
lenten ratingfour i cant delete comments anymore ever since i updated it ..
lennineteen ratingone pointless to even have on my phone anymore can't even use it like i should be able to..
lentwenty ratingthree the new update has made it so i continually get network error or no internet connection which is just rubbish.
lenfifteen ratingone after updating my system shuts down, i get errors and i can't post anything.
leneight ratingone will not refresh at all on my droid
lentwenty ratingone far too slow never loads , cant see anything , 'crap' any time i refresh it goes straight onto my actual internet !!!
lensix ratingone keeps crashing, forcing it to close.
lenfive ratingone also you carnt view pictures
lensixty ratingone yeah so this app ain't bad i use it more than the browser but that's gonna change, i was wondering why my phone memory was all gone so i decided to uninstall the updates now i got a load more memory, so until you can save this app to the memory card then i'm not using it.
lenseven ratingone won't even let me log in!
lentwentyfour ratingtwo for some reason i cannot update my facebook status, leave comments, like things or perform any action on the mobile device that actually works.
lensix ratingone keeps losing conection, therefore uninstalling updates
lenseven ratingthree on my nexus seven tablet, nothing loads.
lenseven ratingthree i simply get a network error message.
lensixteen ratingone dear facebook,  please stop prompting me to add friends every friggin time i open your app.
lenthirtyseven ratingfive it worked perfectly fine for me until yesturday when i was on my laptop and changed my password, it logged me off my phone so i logged in with the new password and it kept saying error.
lenfive ratingtwo can't remove comments anymore.
lentwenty ratingthree once more will ask me this app to find friends from phone contacts list i will remove it i swear.
lentwentynine ratingfour i gave it 4 due to works and really gd but needs to be less i have it at 33.12 so slow then and i want it to get below then 20
lentwentyfive ratingone keeps playing up freezing lots of force close coming up come on fb sort it out i use it everyday and everyday i have problems
lennine ratingtwo been having issues with newsfeed refresh prior to that.
lentwentyseven ratingone now it tells me i have a single sign-on error, which even the great google search has not given me any clues on how to fix.
lentwentytwo ratingone it will sign in, but won't sync anything and won't post anything so it's basically useless for my purposes.
lentwenty ratingthree so u have to ask me if i want to use my contacts to find friends multiple times a day.
lennine ratingthree can't type two words without the thing crashing...
lentwelve ratingfour the only complaint i have is that it has problems loading pics.
lenfourteen ratingone it's slow to load (probably because it's searching my 'phone for stuff) .
lentwelve ratingone wants access to my 'photos, contacts, their birthdays and so much more!!!
lenfive ratingone i cant share my location :/:=
lentwentyone ratingtwo come on , facebook, every other app on my phone has functioning notifications, why can't you mange to get it right?
lenseventeen ratingthree wow my facebook use to be so slow it is so much faster and hasnt frozen yet.
lenseven ratingone the recent update has blank pages now.
leneight ratingone i cant see any pictures on my app.
lenfourteen ratingtwo the app runs extremely slow and sometimes not at all on the mobile network.
lentwelve ratingtwo pictures wont load and neither will contents.works fine threw wi-fi.
lentwentyfour ratingone the problem is it is constantly syncing and that drains battery  uninstall for an hour and you will notice huge increase in battery life
lentwelve ratingone it kicks me out once a day and drains my battery completely.
lenten ratingone my facebook is even slower than it already was before.
lenten ratingone it forced me to update which should be our choice.
lensixteen ratingone plz can i save pic, and iportent can i dalete comt from my pic and stetes....
lenfive ratingtwo vryy sloww and too heavy..
lensix ratingtwo almst occupy my whole system memory...
lenseventeen ratingone after auto correct got a word wrong i went back to change it, then the app froze.
lentwenty ratingone however, recently i have found myself waiting for an eternity to get anything to load properly if it even does.
lenfiftyfive ratingone well i have top of the range phone,  fastest internet in the uk and this app fails constantly, how can a company this large not create a working application is beyond me,  slow, pictures and comments regularly fail to load, constant network errors and to top it off facebook fail to respond to these issues...
lennineteen ratingtwo when trying to watch a youtube video through fb, the option to watch through the youtube app is gone.
lenseventeen ratingtwo you're automatically taken to the mobile youtube site where it says the video cannot be played.
lensixteen ratingtwo pretty frustrating, since it happens every single time i try to watch a posted youtube video.
leneight ratingtwo pics on the status update page dont load...
lenfive ratingone this app is so slow.
lenfourteen ratingone why don't i have the same options i do on the facebook website?
leneleven ratingone why can't i remove posts from people on the app?
lenseven ratingone why can i hide stories or pictures?
lenfourteen ratingone and lastly it's very slow loading and sometimes doesn't load at all.
lentwentyone ratingone the update said "faster viewing of photos" and now i can't see any pics at all, not even profile pics!
leneleven ratingtwo wont let me upload pictures and only notify's me sometimes?
lentwentyfour ratingone slow, forces close all the time and notifications don't clear from home screen on the phone even when logging off and on again.

lenseven ratingone signal is good but app says not.
lenfour ratingone no access to pages.
lenfourteen ratingone can't find them (used to find with friends ) or follow comments any longer.
lenfifteen ratingone afterwards, photos are just gray squares and they don't always load when clicked on.
lentwentytwo ratingone now with the newest update, i was hoping the problems would be fixed, but instead the pictures won't load at all.
lensix ratingone all sharing options do not work
lenten ratingone the worst thing fr such a top developer, so slowwwwswwwwwwwwww

lentwentyone ratingone i have tried about twenty times to get on my fb and it say connection lost when i have five bars.
lenthree ratingone hangs on updating
lensix ratingtwo i cant post my status updates..
lenfortyseven ratingone this was a good app but now it will not show some posts or it will arrange them in any order that it wants i.e. first post will be from 2 weeks ago, the next post will be from a month ago, then the next from today.
lensix ratingone horrible tos for privacy/app permissions.
lentwentytwo ratingone you *do not* need my private text msgs, my photos, my entire contact list and address book to make this app successful.
lensix ratingone i'm not able to update.
lenseventeen ratingone last update i can't search for friends and won't load profiles or photos please fix
lenfourteen ratingone takes forever to load and most of the time doesn't load at all.

lenfour ratingone screen just goes black.
lenfifteen ratingone i watch youtube and use everything it was ok but why facebook say "lost connection"?!?!?!?
lenfourteen ratingone why i cant post my status, it always says cant post at tis time????
lentwelve ratingone the major problem, i believe is you somehow created a memory leak.
lenfortytwo ratingone i say this because i noticed the more you use the app, the progressively worse it gets, until it doesnt even open or when it needs more memory for lets say a message and a notification at the same time, it crashes.
lenthirtyone ratingone other than that as of right now images do not load the correct image, they skip to a different image, constantly gives false no connection warnings, cannot delete posts plus more.

lentwentysix ratingone update: in this latest version every time i start this app it has a pop up requesting access to my contacts so it can find friends.
lensixteen ratingthree there needs to be alerts for messages to your phone when you don't have wifi .
lenthirty ratingthree because it is terriable that when someone uploads a photo of you and you get the alert but when they send you a message you don't get an alert.

lenthirteen ratingone it also still tells me network error when my connection is perfectly fine
lenfive ratingone still can't upload pictures.
lensix ratingone i can't view any pictures.
lenninetysix ratingthree this app is slow you can't change covers and facebook should have music so that when someone enters your profile music of your choice plays that will be cool and make the app fast and the option to change covers :d make it happen ill give you 3 stars but if you guys have all this options i mention 5 stars oh yea and have the option were we cant hit like on the friend feeds cause when i scroll down i click like without me liking the picture or video or any c my friends post :/

lenfive ratingfive wasting my time, lagging application .
lenten ratingone its really slow and takes a long time to load -_____-
lenten ratingone it takes up too much internal storage on my phone.

lenfifteen ratingone nothing will load unless you have wifi on and it forces close all the time!
lenten ratingone why i can't update my status and upload myphotos?
lenthirtyfour ratingone one almighty, sleazy mess: force closes 90% of all commands; forces me to read news feed at their pace and won't allow me to like or comment if i read at my own pace!

lennineteen ratingthree it was good at first time  but at the last update was bas casuse it didnt want to start
lenfour ratingone it's sooooo slow.
lensixteen ratingone why have the last few updates make it to where the pictures don't load correctly???

lentwenty ratingtwo very rarely refreshes newsfeed, and tells me it can't post my status as there is a problem, but when.
lentwenty ratingone i can't update my status i can't look and my group comments upload photos or comment on anything.
lenfive ratingone takes up 28mb on my phone.
lentwentyfour ratingone i can't put updates on photos because the key pad blocks the comment area so i can't see what i've typed.
lenfourteen ratingone the problem is that it either capitalizes every word or runs them all together.
lentwenty ratingone since it won't let me see the comment field while the keyboard is open  i can't fix it.
lenfourteen ratingfive update, then force close, go to manage app, clear data, restart fb, sign in...

leneight ratingone it keeps telling me the file in invalid
leneighteen ratingone you want people to use your service, however from the comments and ratings i have seen and read .....
lenten ratingone it force closes non stop, you cant delete comments, etc!!
lentwentyfour ratingfive but pls fix the privacy settings whenever i post status or photo i cant even choose who is only allowed to view my post.
