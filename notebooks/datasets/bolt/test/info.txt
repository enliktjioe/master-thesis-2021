leneleven ratingfour And I want swift key to save the words I type.
lenten ratingfive I think it could do with a bit more customization...
lenthirtyone ratingfive And a few more settings for example, after I insert specific types of punctuation it sometimes put a space after..It would be good to be able to turn that off.
lentwentysix ratingfive Also another good one is being able to make the space bar bigger by removing the smiley key on the bottom right making the keyboard bigger.
lentwelve ratingfour I really would like to see Chinese language integration to be developed.
leneight ratingfour Very annoying to switch with other input methods.
lennine ratingone Does not work with S-Pen on Galaxy Note 2
lentwentyfour ratingfive I love the keyboards and what not it looks so awesome but just need some more themes to choose from or more customization choices.
lenfourteen ratingfive Last time it was smileys/predictions without spaces messing up other languages than english.
lentwenty ratingfive Used to work perfect but after i had accidentally deleted it, can't get it to work again after reinstall.
leneight ratingone It WAS awesome until the layout was changed.
lenthirteen ratingone It may work for large displays but NOT phones with cases on them!
lenseven ratingone I hate the new slide punctuation bar!
lenfive ratingone Bring smaller space bar back!
lentwentyfour ratingone You need to add something to allow us to edit the prediction word database. This way, we can manually erase unwanted crap, periods & commas!!!
lentwentyseven ratingthree When your in messages and lock the screen, once you turn it back on the suggestions are gone and you have to close and re open SwiftKey.
lentwentythree ratingone Everytime I turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and I have to keep activating this one...
lenten ratingthree Great app but without emoji support its only sub par
lennineteen ratingthree Im not fond of the fact, i have to constantly switch to go keyboard for Chinese either,  over rated.
leneleven ratingfour Wish I could customize the layout, then I would give 5 stars.
leneleven ratingfour Awesome keyboard just lags with Google takes forever to show up.
lenfourteen ratingfour I like how you did pumpkin for Halloween can we get a Christmas theme.
lensix ratingfour Because of missing of Macedonian language!
lentwentytwo ratingthree Ever since the jellybean update,  you have to exit the messaging application and open it up again for word prediction to work..
lentwelve ratingthree I also don't like that you can't use swear words.
lentwelve ratingthree I'm 23, please let me use what words I want to use.
lentwelve ratingone I am tired of this fueling keyboard refusing to use swear words.
leneight ratingfour Swiftkey's has limited 3 words predicted for selection.
leneighteen ratingthree I find it terribly annoying that now the prediction bar, and corrections don't work 50% of the time.
lenthirteen ratingthree I have to close the keyboard and then reopen for this to work.
lenthirteen ratingthree Also, I should be able to delete typos that have been presumed predictions.
leneight ratingfour It is missing one thing, however. Emoji support.
lenseventeen ratingfour If this language/font were to be added, SwiftKey would win the award for best Android app.
lenfourteen ratingfive After having the language constantly failing to download, and now not downloading at all.
lenfifteen ratingfive But very glitchy on Google chrome, keeps typing previous word when pressing the backspace key...
leneight ratingfour Only problem i have is the exclamation mark.
lenfifteen ratingfour Very very poor set up,  it almost never works when you swipe the multi button.
leneleven ratingfour Always puts a period or a comma, never an exclamation mark.
lentwelve ratingone Until I updated to Jelly Bean, I would give this app 5 stars.
lentwentyfive ratingone However, following the update on my S3 to Jelly Bean, it now reverts to the Samsung keyboard as the default every time I restart the phone.
lentwentyseven ratingone From my understanding, it is an issue the developers are aware of and have stated that we all need to wait until Jelly Bean is updated to 4.1.2.
lenfour ratingfour I just need Chinese!!!
lenfifteen ratingfour Otherwise it's such a pain to switch keyboards just to type one Chinese character!
lennineteen ratingtwo Keeps rebooting vzw gnex and numerous bug reports and posts left unanswered or even unacknowledged using pay version too...
lentwentyeight ratingfour Just wish there were more themes to choose from and that of your backspace from an auto completed word that it would defer to what you originally typed.
lennineteen ratingfour As stated before SwiftKey does not load after a reboot. It has to be disabled an re enable again.
lenfourteen ratingfour Great keyboard and prediction but needs SWIPE function for portrait mode and better customization
lentwentythree ratingthree Update: Using on the LG Optimus G and the cursor KEEPS  jumping to the top of the field in the middle of sentences.
lensix ratingfour But can't personalized with fb..
lentwentytwo ratingfour Uninstalled until I can save it to the SD card, everything is great except for the amount of space it takes up.
lenfourteen ratingfour This app is very good, but it can run a little laggy on my GS3
lenfourteen ratingfour Give me a red version of the "holo" theme and you'll get 5 stars.
lenthirtyone ratingfive The only thing I do hate is when I enter a full stop then  space it automatically In puts (I) so my sentences start with I when I'm typing fast.
lennineteen ratingone Used to be the best keyboard ever since jellybean update now on my GS3 it will not hold as default :'-(
lenseventeen ratingfive I would love to more themes, the current themes are great but I love customising my phone.
lenfour ratingfour Wheres the clipboard button?
lensix ratingone This auto correct is illogical sometimes.
lennine ratingone When I type "just"  I don't mean "justified".
lenthirteen ratingone It will also auto capitalize words that don't need to be capitalized.
lenfifteen ratingthree Was excellent but pasting has recently broken on my Samsung galaxy s3 which is very frustrating!!
lenthirtythree ratingtwo I don't know what sort of processor is expected for running a keyboard but swift key can't keep up with my typing for the most part on a Samsung galaxy tablet 10.1
lenthirtyone ratingfour Only suggestions I have would be a tab key for use with Web browsers and such and a personal dictionary would be nice to help speed the keyboards learning process up
lensix ratingfive Please add a few themes frequently.
leneighteen ratingone I love this keyboard,  but I notice a significant decrease in my battery life when I use it.
lenten ratingfive It would be perfect if there was a delete key!
lenthirteen ratingtwo I would give it 5 stars if predictive text was supported in all apps.
leneight ratingtwo As it stands, too many apps remain unsupported.
lenseven ratingfive Love it but needs emoji support now
lentwentyfive ratingtwo Pretty good,  I get sick of checking everything to make sure it's predicting what I actually wanted, it seems to lag a lot too
lensix ratingfive Just wish it had more themes.
lentwelve ratingfive One like Holo but red in place of the blue would rock.
lennine ratingfive Only thing is it couldn't input Chinese language.
lenthirtythree ratingfive I love this app best $3 I've ever spent drastically increases texting speed if you have it set up right could use some more themes like a black background with neon green letters
lentwentytwo ratingfive The one and only problem I have is this program needs to do a better with choosing which punctuation sentences should receive.
lentwentytwo ratingfive I would like it if there were emoticon add ons for this keyboard like there are some of the other ones though...
lentwentysix ratingthree This app is okay except that the keys are loud when I type, so if I'm working or hunting I have to change the settings.
lentwentytwo ratingthree And if I'm just not finding how to change the setting I apologize but I've looked everywhere on the phone
lenthree ratingfour Needs more themes!
lentwentyfour ratingfour Love the ".com"  button but I wish it were in a different place. Maybe put it on the left side of the space bar.
lenfour ratingtwo You need more themes..
lenthirteen ratingtwo It's a great keyboard,  I just get board with the limited options
leneight ratingone It's useless application with Jelly Bean keyboard.
lentwentyfive ratingfour In the Dvorak layout, the lowercase 'M' & 'W' keys are supposed to display '(' & ')' on long press. The 'W' usually displays a '0' instead, but occasionally readjusts.
lenthirtyfour ratingone This would have been a 4 star but the inability to hide the "com" button while in a browser renders it nearly useless. Hit it all the time when trying to hit the space bar.
lentwentyeight ratingfive I'll lower my rating to 4 stars since the Jelly Bean bug resetting the keyboard to stock at each reboot has been around for long without being fixed.
lenfifteen ratingfour I the only reason I give it a 4 is because there is no swipe texting.
lentwelve ratingfour Would you be able to make an update with Vietnamese language though?
lenten ratingfive Just hope they continue to make it more battery efficient...
lenfifteen ratingthree 1 - The keyboard reverts to the original Android Keyboard every time the USB storage becomes disconnected.
lentwentysix ratingthree Every time I hook up to the computer or shut down the phone and restart, I have to re-enable it via the Android OS Settings.
lentwentythree ratingthree Great in most circumstances, but when sending odometer readings via text for tracking purposes, there's no reason for it to track it.
lennineteen ratingthree Numbers, for the most part, could probably be ignored or at least give us the option to ignore them.
lenfourteen ratingthree I don't need it suggesting an odometer reading I'll never see again.
lentwentyone ratingthree It would also be nice to be able to edit the remembered words and add or remove words, especially in multiples.
leneight ratingfour But could you guys add a swiping option?
lentwentyone ratingthree If I take the time to manually capitalize letters and add apostrophes, etc, then swiftkey shouldn't try to change it.
lensix ratingone Needs improvement in Arabic language support
lentwentyfive ratingfour My only wish is the ability to add words to dictionary & more keyboard options with symbols like hearts that come standard on most Samsung galaxy s3
lennineteen ratingfive The only weird thing I encountered was on my RAZR while it's charging the keyboard acts very weird.
lentwelve ratingfive Amazing app, although I wish there were more themes to choose from.
lenseventeen ratingfour It doesn't allow you to use the prediction features on text fields that already have it.
lentwenty ratingfour An example is when you type something on Google search app, you're abandoned to the slow typing process again.
lensixteen ratingfour The same happens in some contact names fields such as Gmail, GOSMS Pro, Any.do. Etc.
lenfortyfour ratingtwo I was not happy with the keyboard after coming from iPhone to Android until i tried Swiftkey, HOWEVER, i have  found quite a few apps that refuse to show the predictive text...like the built in browser on my Galaxy S3 and way more Update;
lentwentyone ratingtwo giving up until they fix predictive text and make keyboard thy doesn't have all th keys basically touching each other.
lenfourteen ratingone whenever i wanna use the sign () it always write wrong and impossible to use.
lenthirtyfive ratingone i have tried to ask if possible to add "numbers" on top of the keyboard like on Samsung original keyboard and they sent me to write on their blog... but no one answer, nobody care...
lentwenty ratingfour I'm using the trial keyboard, but can't miss the sale off :), buy it and waiting for Vietnamese language...
lentwentyone ratingfour I would really like to see more customization like more keyboard clolors and maybe some emoj that's different from iPhone.
lenten ratingtwo This keyboard is good but it really needs more theme.
leneleven ratingtwo Just at least one of all the major colors. ESPECIALLY RED!
lentwelve ratingfour Please made available for moving app to rom for faster keyboard entries
lentwentynine ratingone It always adds spaces after full stops, and adds unwanted words after commas, I wish I hadn't paid for this before I knew there was a free version
lenthirteen ratingtwo Have turned off as does not support pen entered text on Samsung note 2.
lenten ratingtwo Have turned off as note ii does not work properly.
lentwentysix ratingtwo If you are not going to fix it then make it assignable to applications so it can be ignored for apps where it doesn't work.
lenfive ratingthree I want more color fonts
lensix ratingthree Why is there no Tab key?
lentwentyeight ratingthree But when I have to put numbers into a password or messaging someone and using numbers the numbers come out jumbled, please look into this, sent from my gs3
lentwentytwo ratingtwo I use it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 on Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean. The only complaint I do have are a couple of bugs.
lentwentyeight ratingtwo On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
lenthirteen ratingtwo I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook.
lenten ratingtwo It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
lenfour ratingone Fatal support for Polish.
lenthirteen ratingfour I really dislike how it fails to show predictions during Web browser use.
lensixteen ratingfive There are so many things you can tweak as well such as prediction invoking and theme.
lenthirty ratingfour Totally annoying when I'm used to typing as best I can and picking predictions from the list. At least please give us the option to turn it on / off.
lentwentythree ratingfour The only issue with it is that about 35% of the time the prediction bar does not show up/auto correct does not work.
lennine ratingtwo Great app but becomes sluggish every now and then.
leneighteen ratingfour However, give me the option to disable the auto space after punctuation and ill give it five stars.
lentwentyseven ratingtwo It's not a bad keyboard replacement but it insists on putting a space after periods, making it a real pain to type URLs into text messages.
lenthirteen ratingfour The only thing I really dislike is the space it adds after punctuation.
lenthirtyfour ratingfour I'm used to typing correctly in the first place so I add the space myself and SwiftKey adds one as well as you can see in this review with all the double spaces.
lenten ratingfour I want to turn predictions completely OFF, but can't?
lensix ratingfour 5 stars if could turn off predictions.
lentwentytwo ratingfive I'd love to see the option to enable a dedicated number row though, for those of us with those huge phones.
lensix ratingfour Just add emojis and more themes.
leneighteen ratingfour Would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
leneighteen ratingfive Would like S Pen support for Galaxy Note 2 so I don't have to swap when writing documents.
lenthirteen ratingthree But the predictions bar doesn't appear for for the Samsung at all..
lenseventeen ratingthree And when I'm typing rapidly and trying to press the space button.. It hits the. com
lennineteen ratingtwo Whenever I try to enter a search term this app seems to stop working all together... Why is that?
lenseven ratingfive Wish for more keyboard themes to come.
lentwentysix ratingfive Love this keyboard and just got the update to JB on my EVOLTE and was wondering if you guys were implementing Emoji support for the keyboard?
lentwo ratingthree Emoji support.
lenseven ratingthree Why doesn't any keyboard have emoticons?
lentwentysix ratingfour This keyboard is amazing but the only problem I have with it is that when I use Google drive it slows down and lags SO much.
lenseven ratingfive I just wish they would add swipe
lennineteen ratingfive Would like to see a couple more themes, but I have no complaints as the Holo theme is gorgeous.
lentwentythree ratingfour I think it provides a great writing experience, but it slows down my overall smartphone readiness and needs an huge amount of ram..
lenfive ratingfour A ridiculous amount of RAM!
lenfourteen ratingthree Please provide swipe support like the latest keyboard update provided by Google for nexus.
lenthirteen ratingthree When ever I enter my email address the auto space messes shot up.
leneighteen ratingthree Lack of hand writing support for the Note 2 is a shame, will inable again when this is supported.
lennine ratingthree Loved Swiftkey3 on my evo hate it on the note
lennine ratingtwo A lot of bugs in connection with hardware keyboards!
lennine ratingtwo The app also has trouble downloading the language packs ...
lentwentyseven ratingone Now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up AT ALL and it seems like words are being put in that I NEVER was attempting to write.
lentwentyfive ratingone Also, I am not too fond of the fact that when I do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
leneleven ratingtwo Love the word suggestions but keyboard locks up constantly on my S3
lennine ratingfive But can we have more themes for the keyboard =)
lentwentythree ratingfive Edit: The keyboard stop predicting when I am in Any.do, Facebook web browser and several other applications that I couldn't remember.
lenthirtysix ratingthree Though India is a big client of all mobile handsets and apps, everybody is neglecting Indian customers and their needs,I am hopefully waiting for Hindi,Marathi and other Indian languages upgrade packs from swiftkey ASAP.
lenforty ratingthree However,  every time I close all apps and ram memory and I go on any sort of message board,  texting or any type of typing it doesn't automatically pop up with SwiftKey and it shows the regular crappy keyboard.
lentwenty ratingthree Long story short I have to go change the options to have SwiftKey on every time I want to text.
lentwentyone ratingfive Suggestion for the developer: make that when the hardware is changed you don't loose all that the app has learned.
lensixteen ratingfive I wish there were more personalization options with colors, to match the theme For your phone.
lensix ratingfour Won't start automatically on GS3 however.
leneight ratingtwo But it is not compatible with 4.1.1  So frustrated.
leneighteen ratingone Split keyboard does NOT work on the Note in spite of thousands of users flagging it inside reviews.
lennine ratingthree I hope that swiftKeys will implement chinese typing too.
lentwelve ratingthree The keyboard gets laggy sometimes and makes apps lag on jelly bean.
leneleven ratingthree Most notably Google now.... it's very slow whilst using swiftkey.
leneight ratingfive I wish there will be more themes added
lenthree ratingfive Please integrate swype.
lentwentynine ratingfive Anyway I couldn't thank SwiftKey any better for such an amazing keyboard, just wish that they will come out with better features and personalization along with new themes!
lenfive ratingone Prediction does not work anymore.
leneight ratingfive I only wish they had more color scheme.
lenfourteen ratingone With a recent update to Jellybean, SwiftKey no longer automatically uses predictions when texting.
lentwentytwo ratingone I have to back out of every message and go back in before it will start fixing typos or using predictive text.
lenfourteen ratingthree I was very disappointed that when installing the paid version it did NOT import.
lentwentyfour ratingthree The settings from the trial version and now i am left having to battle the same initial problems when i first inatalled the trial.
lenfifteen ratingthree Very disappointing that such an intuitive app is so non-intuitive in the upgrade process
lentwenty ratingone Since I updated my S3 to Kelly Bean sometimes SwiftKey is not even activating when I go to text or type.
lenthirtyfour ratingone I have to exit whatever I'm doing or send a text or 2 before it will start working, but as I said it's very inconsistent, was never an issue while using with ICS.
lenfiftyone ratingfour I love this keyboard hands down the best one on the market only issue is for some reason when I I'm typing fast the keyboard always seems to static like a tv with no service I thought it was my phone but now I have the note 2 n same thing..
lentwentyseven ratingfour I just hate how when I click the 123 icon on the keyboard I hate how the layout looks,  im use to the regular S3 keyboard 123456789 on the top
leneleven ratingfive 5 stars either way but an Emoji add on would be awesome.
lentwelve ratingthree I don't like the way that it handles using different languages.
leneighteen ratingthree I wish there was a way to toggle between languages instead of having them integrated into one keyboard.
lenthirteen ratingthree Would have given this 5 stars if it worked well with king soft office.
lensix ratingfive Drawback, could do with more skins.
lenthirtyfour ratingfour Great keyboard only issue I have is when my phone wakes into a text it doesn't use prediction so I have to back out and go back in for the prediction to work
lennine ratingfour Was working excellently on 4.0.3, but in 4.0.4, has some defects...
lenfifteen ratingfour Feeling a small hick when keyboard comes on screen and sometimes it does not work...
leneighteen ratingthree Can't go without this keyboard anymore, though I'd still love to be able to disable gestures
lenfive ratingfive It does occasionally stop typing.
lensix ratingthree Kinda laggy when opening and closing..
lenthirteen ratingfour Just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
leneleven ratingfive The Arabic implementation is very good but needs some fine tuning
lensix ratingtwo Can't remember my email address.
lensix ratingtwo Has a problem remembering simple words.
lenthirteen ratingthree Please fix the cause for the keyboard not sticking as the default keyboard.
lentwentythree ratingthree I used this a long time ago, and picked it up for a buck during the sale, but it needs more customization options.
lenseven ratingthree Namely, the smiley key needs custom smileys.
lentwelve ratingone Pls update thai language i have been waiting for the long time
lentwentytwo ratingtwo Sometimes word prediction doesn't show up. Have to exit out of keyboard then get back on again for it to appear.
lenthirteen ratingfive really loving it ;)  wish it wouldnt eat so much ram tho 28mb of ram?!
lentwentyfour ratingfour I would like some more customization options, such as disabling the keypress letter highlight, custom skins (even if just hex colors from a file).
lenthirteen ratingfive I have no complaints, just a request that you keep adding new themes!
lennine ratingfive English, of course, but with Korea prediction and everything?
lensixteen ratingfour The beta edition for Thai has been expired. Could you add it to any Thai peoples?
lenthirtytwo ratingfive My only flaw is since the jelly bean update if I have the keyboard open in messages and my screen locks; once the screen comes back the prediction function doesn't work
lenfifteen ratingfour It works great for everything but not so good when add ing non common names.
leneighteen ratingone something is happening and it is causing me to have to download the language over and over again.
leneight ratingthree But I would love a cleaner looking interface.
lenseventeen ratingthree Would love to have a option to hide all the extra long press keys minus the numbers.
lenfifteen ratingtwo Frankly some of the predictions are ridiculous you are better off with the normal keyboard.
lenfive ratingthree Not compatible with jelly bean.
lenfive ratingthree Resets after boot or restart.
lenseven ratingthree Will not set itself as default keyboard.
lenseventeen ratingone I recommended it to all of my friends, but ever since ics this app has been HORRIBLE.
lenfive ratingone The keyboard is horribly laggy.
lentwelve ratingone I've downloaded it more than 3 times and it keeps saying error
lentwentyone ratingfive Only issue found till date is that it crashes often with chrome, but that is not a deal breaker for me.
lenfive ratingfour Only complaint: no swype mode.
leneight ratingfive Would be better if echo stopped cheating though
lenthirteen ratingfive Would be cool if we could have some emojis added on to it
lennine ratingone Due to error 941 this is bs. Cannot refund either
lenfive ratingtwo Wouldn't install on my gs3
lenten ratingone I just purchased this app but it says error downloading.
lenfive ratingone It does not install. Error 941
lentwentytwo ratingfour I enjoy this app as it helps correct my errors fast but it doesn't remember the personal words I put in.
lennine ratingfour And I'd like to see more, newer themes.
lenseventeen ratingfive The only thing that I can think of to make this app better would be more themes!
leneleven ratingfive I just wish there was an option to hide the keyboard.
lenten ratingfive Bigger space bar, more themes, faster responses, and more intuitive.
lentwelve ratingone Every time you reboot your device it reverts back to stock keyboard!
lentwentytwo ratingfour As mentioned by some others some times it seems to slow down on certain other apps while the original never did so.
lentwentyseven ratingfour I sure don't mind but at the same time making even speedier and smooth as jelly bean is on my s3 would always be greatly appreciate it.
lenseventeen ratingfive They updated recently with two new themes, but they're too girly. How about a few more?
lenten ratingfive It would be nice if it used the personal dictionary.
lenthirteen ratingfour Developers could add a slide type of writing and that would be awesome.
leneleven ratingfour I would give it a 5 if i support chinese as well.
lentwentyseven ratingone But after a month of having it, it became extremely slow, typing on the screen would not happen, half the time corrections would not even show up.
lenfifteen ratingfour But since I root my phone, I constantly change roms, therefore reseting all my words.
lensix ratingfour It feels bad reseting 2000 custom words.
lenfiftynine ratingthree I was hoping to have a good heart symbol with the key board because that's something a girl uses a lot for commenting on photos and stuff like that if added, and I would be much happier with the application and rate it a five stars but, there are not a lot of color choices for your keyboard......
lenthirtysix ratingfour The functional keys in the bottom: shift, enter, backspace etc. come in a certain color with every theme. I would like this color to be fully customisable to make it fit my phone's theme better.
lenten ratingthree Best prediction keyboard available but mediocre design and button placement.
lenthirteen ratingfour Amazing keyboard and good value but it needs to have slide/swipe options.
lentwentyone ratingone Predictions and double space bar to accept predictions and insert period are not longer available in browsers and many other apps.
lenfive ratingtwo Spell check randomly stops working.
lenten ratingtwo Prediction will sometimes turn off when I sleep the phone.
leneleven ratingfour Need S-Pen button and writing grid for the galaxy note!
lenthirteen ratingfour Needs better emotes and I thinks that's it except maybe custom keyboards.
leneighteen ratingfour If you could customize the keyboard to a different colour for all keyboards, I will give you 5 stars.
lensixteen ratingfour The back-spacing on the keyboard is a bit slow. I wish I could adjust it.
lentwentyfour ratingtwo This work great for a while but now keeps crashing my phone and my phone won't work again until I pull the battery
lentwentythree ratingfive Just need to be sure that you check over what you're typing as it can get weird if you're not careful.
lenfour ratingfour Just add swype pleeease
lennineteen ratingfour Only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is I can not use swype as on the Samsung keyboard.
lenthirteen ratingtwo SK3 was working flawlessly until the AT&T JB update for S3 recently came out.
lentwentysix ratingtwo When locking the screen while having the text field open and the keyboard out and then unlocking the phone, the text field rewrites itself and resizes.
lenthirteen ratingtwo Also, there is lag in the keyboard processes when sending and receiving messages.
leneleven ratingtwo Will return to give 5 stars once jb update issues are resolved.
lenthirtysix ratingthree I would like to see the numbers separately above the the first row of the keys. And when on land scape mode it takes up the whole screen and will not show you the text screen.
lentwentyfour ratingfive I've had it for a whole but avoided using it because it doesn't matter have the heart symbol like the Samsung keyboard.
lenseven ratingfive (I still hope for some hearts :D)
lentwelve ratingfive I do wish it supported Japanese characters, but otherwise it's perfect.
lenthirteen ratingfour Plzzzz i luv swiftkey but no vnmese support is a dealbreaker for me
leneighteen ratingfour Nice keyboard but even in its new v3 incarnation there's no dedicated voice key, hence losing a star.
lennine ratingfour C'mon Swiftkey, YOU NEED A DEDICATED VOICE KEY!
lennineteen ratingtwo It doesn't have a percent symbol, what the hell kind of keyboard doesn't have a percent symbol
lensixteen ratingtwo Would be awesome if it didn't keep resetting back to its original settings every 5 mins.
lentwentytwo ratingfour atm the lowest sound level for the type writer style sound is way too loud, I'd really like a quieter option!
lenthirteen ratingfive wish there was some more themes for it like maybe a pink one? :-)
lentwentythree ratingtwo Used to work brilliantly with previous android versions but the Swiftkey auto correct function stopped working after using it with Android jelly bean.
lenthirtythree ratingthree As much as is pains me to say, this app has been the root of a bunch of problems on my phone. Crashes and freezing are all too familiar when this is active.
lenseven ratingfour But I wish it used less memory!
lenthirteen ratingfour The word "it's" is almost impossible and always comes out as "is".
leneight ratingfour Also could you allow use of could words?
leneight ratingfour Please integrate learning from WhatsApp Messenger as well.
lenthirtysix ratingfour At the bottom corner there's an option for the regular smileys while texting but can there be an option to switch those to emoji or even an option to change them to what you want?
lenseven ratingfive Sometimes wish it had more themes though.
lennine ratingfour Only snag is the haptic feedback doesn't work.
leneleven ratingfour However the shift key could be either less sensitive or moved.
lenthirteen ratingfour Often times when I hit the "A" key I hit the shift key.
lensixteen ratingone I can't download the language pack. It's the same error over and over again.
lensixteen ratingthree Good app but the Turkish dictionary is very insufficient. It doesn't contain many basic words.
lennineteen ratingfour I request developers to add the support for training the keyboard through whatsapp similar to twitter, Google and Facebook.
lensix ratingthree Suggested words were never accurate either.
lensixteen ratingfour It's good but I'm only going it 4 stars because it doesn't have swype.
lensix ratingthree The best,no s-pen detection?
lensix ratingthree where is handwriting for s pen?
lensixtythree ratingfive My only issue with this and it's a SERIOUS issue with me is that since I got the update for my S III to 4.1 is that I can not find out how to turn off the haptic feedback when I type. The phone's settings have it turned off but no matter what I do to try and troubleshoot it, nothing works.
lenfour ratingfour would love more themes!
lenfifteen ratingthree But, it's been almost a year and I think one new theme was added!
lennine ratingthree Come on guys... Get on board the theme wagon!
lentwelve ratingfive Would like to see manual selection between languages instead of auto detection.
lentwentytwo ratingfive This by far the best keyboard out there, but with my recent update to JB, its kinda laggy and not so functional.
lentwenty ratingthree As mentioned by others, Google search has slowed with the keyboard not appearing for several seconds when using this keyboard.
lentwentynine ratingfive I have had this keyboard since I first got the Evo, I just love it, I wish it allowed me to input emojis but it is still a 5star app!
lentwelve ratingfour SwiftKey please add: Swipe, personal dictionary and prediction for email and name.
lenfive ratingone Not working with jelly bean
lenfourteen ratingfour Some of the predictive text functions are annoying but its a good app otherwise.
lensix ratingfour Pleeeaassseee come out with more themes....
lenfourteen ratingfour I'd still like an editable dictionary of the words that it has learned.
lenfour ratingtwo Closes while I type.
lennineteen ratingtwo Puts in wrong words when I have the right words and completely omits words when I type too fast.
leneleven ratingtwo Oh and the voice recognition of voice to text barely works.
lenfifteen ratingfour After updating to jb, there is no heptic intensity control. It's always full blast.
lentwenty ratingfive But i don't like keyboard skin model, if you can make keyboard skin like original keyboard, itu Will great
lenthirty ratingthree Just updated my AT&T galaxy s3 from os 4.0.4 to the new 4.1.1 jelly bean and my paid version of swift key 3 no longer works and keeps force closing fix this please??
lenfortyeight ratingfive If you just make it possible to sync user dictionary with Google drive so we can have it with Multiple devices (that will let you have the new words you typed in all of your devices) and don't lose them if you wipe or change the device.
lenfifteen ratingfive Syncing will be great in background with every time the keyboard shows up and disappears.
lenten ratingfive Or please add a way to customize your own theme.
leneighteen ratingfour swiftkey is really a good keyboard.. but not perfect for me, hope can improve by adding chinese language.
lenten ratingfour besides, slide to delete not so sensitive, hope can improve
lentwentyseven ratingfive Updated to Jelly Bean. I have all haptic feedback turned off on my phone, but after the update it has been turned back on only using SwiftKey.
lenfive ratingfive It's draining my battery.
leneleven ratingone My phone stoped responding While using the keyboard seince recent update.
lenseven ratingfive Just improve the polish and french dict. :-)
lentwentythree ratingfour This keyboard was stunning on my old Galaxy Ace2 but I now use Galaxy S3 mini running Jelly Bean 4.1 and now Swiftkey will not work.
lenthirtytwo ratingfour The keyboard refuses to pop-up when i require to type ( in all apps including txt, kingsoft office, WhatsApp log-in's etc) and I hve to revert to the Samsung keyboard.
lenfive ratingfour Regretably had to un-install.
lenthirteen ratingfive The swipe down gesture to minimize the keyboard doesn't work very well.
lentwentyseven ratingthree Now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up AT ALL and it seems like words are being put in that I NEVER was attempting to write.
lentwentyfive ratingthree Also, I am not too fond of the fact that when I do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
lentwelve ratingfive we need more themes!! like a red and green one for Christmas!!
lenthree ratingfive or color personalization
lenthirteen ratingtwo Now there are 5 croatian letters at most right making all keys unbelievably tiny!!
lennine ratingtwo And I don't want to type in landscape.
lenten ratingone Autocorrect no longer works since they put out swiftkey flow.
lenfortyone ratingfive Have noticed a bug with it though (although not sure if this is a bug with the keyboard or with android), whenever my phone runs out of battery or I restart it for any reason, the keyboard defaults to Samsung Keyboard.
lensixteen ratingone After turning on phone keyboard does not load. Have to go into settings and choose again.
lensix ratingthree It misses the hinglish language support.
lenthirtyone ratingfive It still lags on viber but over all it is amazing but yeah when is SwiftKey Flow coming to this app or making a new one the is the flow version??
lentwentysix ratingfour Issue 1: I don't use smileys!! Please give me the option to have a persistent enter key, instead of the smiley key forced by some apps.
leneighteen ratingfour Issue 2: Alt keys layout. Couldn't you just set it out like EVERY OTHER KEYBOARD ON THE MARKET!?
lenthirtythree ratingfour I want my numbers where they are shown on the main screen,  I want my alt keys where they are shown on the main screen. At least give the option to your users.
lentwentyone ratingthree This keyboard is amazing for English but it doesn't have a Japanese option so it's very inconvenient for me.
lenten ratingfour The only 'complaint' is that the themes are quite awful.
lenseventeen ratingone When I'm on Facebook I only get the keyboard. No auto correct or word - guess - er.
lennineteen ratingone Also when I finish a word at the end of a line I can't insert a space bar??
lentwentyfour ratingfive I love this apps,  it's a good keyboard app but i strongly request for the Chinese input cause ii use it a lot.
lenfifteen ratingfour Slow to minimize on JB Maxx HD update, the functionality however destroys ics/jb keyboard.
leneleven ratingfour Awesome keyboard needs more haptic feedback and it will be perfect.
lenthirteen ratingfive Waiting for chinese support, it's amazing to try this kind of input.
lenthirteen ratingfour It would be more awesome if they would add a screen shot key.
lenfive ratingfour Can you add traditional Chinese?
lenfourteen ratingfive The keyboard is now running slow, freezes  takes a while to open and close...
lenseventeen ratingfive I love everything about the app except for one thing, I wish there were more theme options.
lentwelve ratingfour I have a galaxy note and the swiping feature doesn't work..
leneight ratingtwo Love the keyboard but its really slow now
lentwelve ratingone When I changed it back to the samsung galaxy keyboard it stopped.
lenthirteen ratingfour The only complaint is have is that there isn't a customized dictionary.
lenten ratingfour It doesn't predict words I use all the time
lenten ratingone Pls update thai language im waiting for the long time
lentwelve ratingfour I deducted one star, however, because it causes crashes with some regularity.
lenfour ratingtwo Needs another simultaneous dictionary.
lentwo ratingtwo Annoying censorship.
leneighteen ratingtwo I can understand censoring explicit swearing but words like "gay", "horny" or "sex" get changed into something else.
lenthirteen ratingtwo "Erection" gets go changed into "election" although the letters aren't even near.
lensix ratingtwo Also, apparently, dictionaries not too complete.
lenfour ratingtwo "Egyptian" doesn't exist.
lensix ratingtwo Writing in Portuguese is a pain.
lenthirteen ratingone since the update when i type, it puts random periods and wrong text.
lenthirtythree ratingone I get an error message when I try to install the language pack that says there is a problem with the network connection, make sure your network connection is working, then try again.
lenseventeen ratingone I think the problem may be that this new version of the Note is running Jelly Bean.
lentwelve ratingone I see that some others running Jelly Bean are also experiencing problems.
lennine ratingone If got Chinese input I will give you 5 star.
lenfive ratingone Hope faster get Chinese input!!
lenfour ratingone Were need Chinese input!!!
lennine ratingfive Normal typing just doesn't cut it any more.
lenfortyone ratingfive Normally I would give it only four stars because there are still a few very minor bugs that need ironing out from a power user perspective, but this app is one of the key selling points for Android, in my opinion.
lenthirtynine ratingthree Why is the smiley face button more important than the enter button? With a keyboard that's supposed to be fast and cater to the user it makes no sense as to why this shouldn't be an option.
leneight ratingone Why does it learn from everything except whatsapp?
lentwelve ratingfive The keyboard sometimes have a lag when typing, especially on number pad.
lentwentytwo ratingfive Other thing is that the layout is confusing when you need to quickly use symbol, I like my S3 stock keyboard layout more.
lenthirteen ratingthree Back to 3 stars until they add an option to disable the key popup !!!
lentwentyseven ratingfour My only slight annoyance is when the ".com" key appears. I wish there was an option to hide it, I seem to press it on accident often.
lenfourteen ratingfour Also, why does SwiftKey continually give me a notification for choosing the default keyboard?
lenfourteen ratingone After upgrading to Jelly Bean, this app had stop working, language pack  download failed...
lentwentythree ratingfour I purchased this app because it simply awesome but after I movedto jellybean it'sshowing error crashes and copy and paste optionsare disabled.
lentwo ratingfive More themes..?
lenfourteen ratingthree Works perfect but for some reason it lags when I exit the typing mode.
lentwentyseven ratingfive Only thing is that if you screw up the last word of a text message and hit send it doesn't fix that last word before sending..
leneleven ratingfive Please make it fix the last word when we hit send.....
lenthirteen ratingfour Could use an update for better keys on 7 inch tablets  Like my nexus 7
lenfourteen ratingtwo Im one of those people who depend on auto correct and it never works.
leneleven ratingthree Good keyboard but ''percentage'' symbol missing and not very good performance...
lentwenty ratingone Thanks forbalways adding words when i hit the space bar and for always learning the wrong way to spell words.
lenseven ratingfive Would love to see more themes though!
lenthirteen ratingthree but no compact QWERTY option which I think is essential in portrait view
lenfive ratingtwo Not compatible with jelly bean.
lenfive ratingtwo Resets after boot or restart.
lensix ratingfive more themes would be appreciated dev.
lensixteen ratingfour Please please please revert back to a seperate "!" button like in the old version of swiftkey.
lennineteen ratingfour I press "!" "?" and "." way more often than the letter "q". It deserves its own place. 1 button for 3 common keys?
leneight ratingfour BUT PLEASE HAVE A SEPARATE KEY FOR "!" AND "?"!!!
lenthirtythree ratingfive One thing it needs is the ability to change to the writing pad as I am using the galaxy note 2 and sometimes I prefer it that way, otherwise this is almost near perfect.
lenten ratingfour The only thing I would add is more customisation options!
lentwenty ratingtwo This app is very good w/ English  But Arabic layout is very annoying, Please use Windows layout instead of MAC
lenthirteen ratingfour But why does it take up 27 MB of RAM on my Galaxy Nexus?
leneighteen ratingfour The more RAM programs use the less program you can run EFFICIENTLY, slowing down the phone in general.
lenthirtyfive ratingfour Often I notice slowdown on my phone and find app taking up RAM for no reason and have to uninstall the Hogs. This is similar to the memory leak problem Firefox has on the desktop.
lennineteen ratingfive Could you add a new theme "RED NEON" just like the blue neon (which is great by the way)....
lenfive ratingtwo Arabic letters are rather small
leneight ratingfive but uses good amount of ram in background.
lentwentyfive ratingfour It's a decent keyboard replacement but I feel that the famous prediction and correction engine is a little overhyped especially the auto correction part.
lentwentythree ratingfour For example typing lowercase free standing "i" isn't auto capitalized, typing "whats" isn't auto corrected to "what's" and so on.
lenseven ratingfour It also takes a lot of memory.
lennine ratingfour Sometimes its a bit freaky how predictable this is.
lensix ratingfour Just wish it had more themes.
lenthirteen ratingthree But frequently it does weird things when trying to type on the Web.
lentwentytwo ratingthree (Dolphin) Frequently when entering text in a field it repeats the first key press instead of typing the letters I am pressing.
lenthirteen ratingfive Best keyboard that u can find, thr personalization on it is just unpredictable!
lentwenty ratingfive It would be nice if it had some options to take advantage of the huge screens that are coming out.
lentwentythree ratingfour Good but please have a save to see card option I payed 4 bucks for this and I takes up a lot of space.
leneight ratingfive But would like to see more colors please!
lenfourteen ratingfive this is the best keyboard ever, but it eats quite a lot of ram
lennine ratingthree Jelly Bean resets Swiftkey when the phone is restarted.
lensix ratingfive Any chance to add Chinese language?
lensix ratingfive Just wish you could swipe also
lenfour ratingone Main problem prediction (lithuanian).
lenthirteen ratingone Would be more stars if there was possibility to turn off the prediction.
lentwentytwo ratingthree Now it seems to be making up its own words and not correct anything even when I have cleared the language data.
lenten ratingthree It needs a number row like the stock note keyboard
lenthirteen ratingtwo When I use this keyboard on my gs3 it is very unresponsive and laggy.
lentwentytwo ratingfive Only complaint is the amount of RAM needed and the delay that occurs when closing the keyboard after hitting the home button.
leneleven ratingfour I will support you if you add support for Japanese language.
lentwentythree ratingfour It kinda annoys me that it has persian (who in the world speaks persian) and not such a widely known language as Japanese.
lenthree ratingfive More themes please.
lenfifteen ratingfour Only request is for a collapse keyboard button. Sometimes buttons like that are just needed.
lensix ratingone Time for more themes thank u
leneight ratingfive Love it, all it needs is more themes.
lenten ratingfour I'll give 5 stars when the Jellybean issue is fixed.
lenten ratingone I want to see performance increased for the Samsung Galaxy S3.
leneight ratingfive All the app really lacks is more themes.
leneight ratingfive Good keyboard but, can we disable the prediction?
lenten ratingfive Once the swype features are added it'll be unrivalled!
lenthirteen ratingfive Just wish you had more themes or ability to make a custom theme.
lentwenty ratingone I dont know what the dev thought when he decided to ask for email and facebook access (major security concern).
lennineteen ratingtwo The app is supposed to allow y to delete mistaken words you don't want in the language model.
lentwentythree ratingtwo I press and hold the prediction, and there is no option to delete! It's really annoying because common typos then become predictions
lenseventeen ratingthree After reboot im locked back into the Samsung keyboard, help me it is already set for default
lensixteen ratingfour But the only downside is that since jellybean update its constantly "forget" the default keyboard selection...
lenseventeen ratingthree Overall product quality is very good except it's user defined library doesn't work with whatsapp.
lennine ratingthree Because of whatsapp issue I can just give 3 stars...
lenthirtyfive ratingfive My only concern is that when entering emails the app needs to recognize that you are doing so and needs to adjust accordingly (eithout automatically spacing after periods, auto capatilizing letters for certain email addresses).
lenfive ratingtwo But really bad performance on 4.1.
lenseven ratingtwo Hangs often and really slow button response.
leneighteen ratingfour The only issue I have is that it is slow to start up at times in most apps.
lenthirteen ratingfour Please fix the slow start up times and this is a perfect keyboard!
lenfifteen ratingfour I love this keyboard but have started having an issue after upgrade to Jelly Bean.
lentwentythree ratingfour The Predictions row gets turned off each time I wake the screen if the keyboard was open when the screen goes to sleep.
lenten ratingfour If I close the keyboard and reopen, predictions come back.
lenseven ratingfive Let's get some more themes now! ;-)
lenseventeen ratingfour but now that i use voice input, there is no easy way of inserting a full stop.
lentwentynine ratingfour add a feature so that while talking to the mobile, there is another button beside the mic icon to insert a fullstop and you willl get your 5 stars back!
lentwentyfour ratingfive Certainly the best for typing, the only thing I would like you to improve in a upcoming update is maybe a few more themes?
lentwentytwo ratingfive As petty as it sounds I would love a red keyboard to match the rest of my phone's theme and case!
lennine ratingfour All we need is Chinese input (I prefer strokes)
lensix ratingone No word prediction in various browsers.
lenfive ratingone No dedicated # row option either.
lenfifteen ratingthree If only you can move cursor by sliding finger accros the keyboard, not with arrows.
lentwentytwo ratingone It's been MONTHS since hundreds if not thousands of users faithfully and trustingly waiting for the additional of Chinese language support.
lenten ratingone But with more languages added,Chinese never made the list.
lensixteen ratingthree SwiftKey makes my typing hella fast and easier but there need to have a Chinese input..
leneight ratingfour 1 suggestion, pls add more theme for this app
lenthirteen ratingfive If they could integrate a bit of slide like FlexT9 it would be unbeatable.
lentwelve ratingthree Auto correct and predictions only work on few apps for jelly bean.
lennine ratingthree Can't even get it for the default browser.
lentwentytwo ratingthree Also, when I have the keyboard enabled, it for some reason disables the handwriting feature in the Samsung Keyboard for the Note 2
lennineteen ratingfour I like this a lot more than the standard key pad thing, would get 5 stars if you added swype.
lentwo ratingfive More themes!
leneight ratingone I can download any language except for English.
lensix ratingtwo **still not saving any new words!!
leneleven ratingtwo Seems to have totally forgotten a lot of my saved words.
leneighteen ratingtwo Also if I type too fast it just deletes the word and I have to type it again.
lennine ratingthree Changed to three stars because it loves the battery.
lenten ratingthree Cut my S III's battery time almost in half.
lentwentytwo ratingthree PLZ make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz make the key board respond faster
lenfour ratingfour EXELENT BUT NO WWW
lenthirtyone ratingfive My only gripe is that when I hit close to the 'i'  key I sometimes hit the 'u' key instead,  and i never use u for you so this bothers me.
lenseventeen ratingone It doesn't support one hand operation which is so essential for the giant screen of Note 2.
lentwelve ratingthree I use the swipe on android and this keyboard  dont have it
lenten ratingthree I don't like how laggy it can be sometimes.
lentwelve ratingthree It is especially bad when I switch between numbers/symbols and letters.
leneighteen ratingthree I also have speed issues when I'm touch typing like I would on the normal android keyboard.
lennineteen ratingfour But PLEASE add swipe right as a redo. (swipe left deletes a word,  so swipe left undoes that deletion).
lenseven ratingfour I often find myself accidentally deleting words...
lenfourteen ratingthree Its take so much time for pop up and its typing speed is slow
lenfourteen ratingthree The predictions don't show up and it won't auto correct my words.
lentwentytwo ratingone My version has a few misspelled words that it automatically displays in the predictions window. Cannot edit the dictionary to remove them.
lenseven ratingone SmartSpace is terrible, unadjustable, and too invasive.
lenten ratingone FYI: SwiftKey doesn't like the Moto LapDock at all.
lentwentyfive ratingfour Certain behaviors like automatic spacing after periods are a pain in the @$$ when trying to type in my email address that has periods in it.
lenten ratingfour An option that disables automatic spacing after punctuation is necessary.
lenthirteen ratingfour I would also like to see an option to edit the personal dictionary.
lentwelve ratingfour Its a great keyboard however I wish it suppoerted the samsung swipe.
lentwenty ratingtwo As mentioned in title, please consider to add numeric key at top row, this will significantly improve the typing speed
lenseventeen ratingfive Bug: when typing words beginning with a capital letter on Firefox, that word won't be written
lenfive ratingone And plz provide new themes.
lenfourteen ratingfour Sometimes the auto predict won't even come up when you're texting/typing.
lentwentyseven ratingfour Some of the minor problems I have with it are the fact that the keyboard wants to insert an I if you hit enter after a period.
leneighteen ratingfour I like the fact that it can predict my words but I rarely start a sentence with I.
lenforty ratingfour Also some of the words it will allow me to type and won't correct are some of the most mispelled words, although there are only a handful and the keyboard will learn which words you use and don't.
lenthirteen ratingthree I love this keyboard, but since updating to 4.2.1, I've got performance issues.
lentwentytwo ratingthree First, the keyboard takes too long to show up  second, the keyboard lags when typing rapidly (it used to be buttery smooth).
lentwelve ratingone Would have been great to receive the incompatibility warning PRIOR to paying.
lensixteen ratingtwo The auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous. Allow the option to turn it off.
leneight ratingone It keeps inserting words I don't want.
lentwo ratingone Limited dictionary.
leneighteen ratingone Costs me way more effort than the std keyboard because I have to go back constantly to correct.
lenfourteen ratingthree Just little niggles like not working correctly in Chrome like user name and captchas.
lensix ratingthree Emoji support would be awesome please.
lentwentytwo ratingfour This is an outstanding app and I would give it a 5 rating if they can add: (1) Swipe functionality and (2) More keyboard themes.
lenten ratingfour The current set of themes lack the look and feel.
lenfifteen ratingone Keeps saying it saved me 10,000 keystroke but it doesnt take into account the 50,000 it missed.
leneleven ratingone Doesnt even put an apostrophe on the doesnt in this critique.
lenfive ratingfive Just lacking the ! shortcut now.
lenthirteen ratingfour I can't fix typos often when I already have typed other words.
lentwentytwo ratingfour I'll go back to fix it and when I press the backspace button, it adds chucks of words instead of erasing.
lensixteen ratingfour Also, when typing in all capitals, the auto correct is very bad. Especially the first one.
lenfifteen ratingfour Rarely has a hiccup, but some keys I'd rather have on the main board.
lentwentyfive ratingfive Speaking of which though, I wish there was Japanese and Chinese available so I don't have to keep switching keyboards just to type those!
lenfour ratingfive Please add more themes
lenseventeen ratingthree Great app but you lose the ability to add standard Samsung characters, like the hearts for example.
lenfour ratingthree Also no personal dictionary.
lentwentyone ratingfour What about being able to learn from whatsapp as I do most of the typing there (most of the people do).
lensix ratingfour We also need Italian keyboard layout
lenthirteen ratingfour I gave it a 4 because I thought it would have more color customization.
lenthree ratingone Need Thai language
lenfive ratingone Dude where are the themes!??
lentwentyfive ratingthree When I just had the trial version the app worked like a charm but now it freezes from time to time for no apparent reason.
lenthirtyone ratingthree I am forced to exit the program and start over from the beginning-sending emails is even worse - in landscape view it is almost impossible to see what you are writing
lenfourteen ratingfour Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that we can't type in Chinese!!!
lenthirtythree ratingfour I mean, there's even languages I have never heard of, but not Chinese mandarin...oh and another, at times it doesn't automatically autocorrect and a word such as "gjakdn" will pass
leneleven ratingone Tle letter for arabic keyboard is small very difficult to write
lennine ratingfive Only thing I'd change is more theme options
lentwenty ratingfour After my Galaxy Nexus got updated to 4.2, the keyboard was gone.Not just gone as default keyboard, but removed uninstalled.
lennineteen ratingtwo The basic s-pen function is not there and you have to revert back to the basic android application.
lenfourteen ratingfive I commonly have the problem that it will not do predictions in landscape mode.
lensix ratingfive Need a button to toggle predictions.
lenseventeen ratingthree Now it's just like any other keyboard, not keeping my regularly used terms in its dictionary.
lentwenty ratingfour It's lacking customisation to make it efficient enough to compete with Swype which makes touch typing feel like swimming.
lentwelve ratingone The auto correction is totally busted(makes you write like a retard)
lenseven ratingone The setup is overly complicated and confusing.
lenten ratingfour Please add a vibrate setting like the stock Android keyboard.
lenfiftyfour ratingfour I have noticed that the standard Samsung keyboard method will come back every now and then and I have to swipe to get the notification center and change back to "SwiftKey 3" from "Samsung keyboard" on my Galaxy S3. It will happen every time I restart the phone and then try to text or anything else.
lentwentyeight ratingfour On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
lentwentythree ratingfour I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook. It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
lentwentyfive ratingfour The only problem I have with this keyboard is that sometimes it will interpret my fast typing as a deletion swipe, which can be frustrating -
lentwenty ratingthree It doesnt work with fb chat... which is the ideal situation to make use of fast typing and auto correct.
lenthirtytwo ratingfive the only improvement that SwiftKey needs is the ability to paste into whatsapp - to do this right now i have to switch to the Samsung keyboard and hold the 123? Button to paste.
lenthirteen ratingthree The keyboard layout is not to my liking and cannot be changed much...
lentwenty ratingthree If I just press space bar many times it writes a long sentence somebody else wrote me in an email...
lensix ratingtwo There is a ton if lag!
lennineteen ratingtwo I start to type and it doesn't register until seconds later and I've already written a paragraph.
lenfive ratingtwo Eats a ton of RAM.
lentwelve ratingone Major issues with Chrome fields.... Jumps all over the place, erases characters.
lenfourteen ratingthree Personally I find I type less accurately with this keyboard than the stock one.
leneight ratingthree Also don't like the numbers/characters panel.
lenthirteen ratingthree The option to have a more classic looking one wouldn't go amiss.
lenthirteen ratingfive Awesome keyboard but hopefully there will be han yin pinyin support real soon
lentwentyfive ratingone I posted a review telling that on Samsung Galaxy Note doesn't work very well, it keeps crashing and freezing my messaging app and whatsapp.
lentwelve ratingone Sometimes I have to wait MINETES till I can use it again.
lennine ratingfour I can't stand not having a dedicated '?' key.
lenten ratingfive And speed but every update resets my personal word info.
lenseventeen ratingfive Please allow a backup and give us the option to ADD our own words with priority settings.
lenfive ratingfive Excellent keyboard but Japanese please!
leneight ratingone Does not work in dolphin browser on my GS3.
lennine ratingfive Now need feature to backup learned language from typing.
lenfive ratingtwo Why still not support Chinese?
lentwentyeight ratingtwo On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
lenthirteen ratingtwo I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook.
lenten ratingtwo It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
leneighteen ratingfour Easily the best keyboard on Google Play, just needs to catch up with Asian language support, especially Japanese.
leneighteen ratingfive Just needs to add quick-insert of predefined strings, and a few tweaks such as completion with hyphen.
leneleven ratingthree Taking up too much memory of late on jb 37mb at times
lennine ratingone Prediction and ai learning how you type stopped working!
leneight ratingfive But keyboard too small on my Motorola ATRIX.
leneleven ratingthree Good keyboard, great predictions, but loses stars for not having macrons.
lenthree ratingthree Please implement macrons!
leneleven ratingfour I love this app but how come chinese is still unavailable?
lenfour ratingfour When it support Chinese!!
lensix ratingthree But it not have Vietnamese language.
lenten ratingfour Could u guys please add Chinese to the languages list?
lenthirtytwo ratingfive When I use the multitasking multi windows, the SwiftKey keyboard stays the same size when in the Samsung keyboard it gets smaller and the keyboard Window is able to be moved around.
lentwentynine ratingfive One fault could be the lack of personal dictionary as it doesn't allow you to save words you use the most etc other than that it's brilliant.
leneight ratingtwo Would rate this 5  if it  had Japanese language.
lentwelve ratingtwo I saw the update but disappointed to see no Japanese input yet.
lenthirteen ratingthree It's a fairly good keyboard but the autocorrection isn't very strong.
lennine ratingthree For example, typing pf isn't changed to of.
lentwentyfive ratingone For some strange reason the swiftkey keyboard keep on skipping keystrokes in random places as I type, making it completely impossible for me to type
lensix ratingfour Awesome must have, but no emoji.
lenten ratingfour And the Swedish dictionary is broken, splits composite words up.
lenten ratingfive still not loading automatixally at boot even with 4.1.1 os sammy s3
lenfifteen ratingfive I hate how it keeps capitalizing the letter "i" even tho auto capital is off...
lenten ratingfive My "enter"  or "return"  key has disappeared while using WhatsApp.
lentwentyfour ratingfive Even in GoSms, the enter key has shifted to the last row and it's place has been taken by the back arrow key.
lenfourteen ratingthree It's great keyboard but I've waiting for THAI that you're developing :-)
lennineteen ratingfour It's be nice if you could edit smileys or if you had multiple smiley sets to choose from.
lenthirteen ratingfour Just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
lennineteen ratingfour Frustrating since I had to delete all of the learned suggestions, but it's back so I'm happy.
leneight ratingfour Great app but wish there were more themes
leneight ratingfive Sure would like to see some new themes
leneight ratingthree Keeps switching back to the dafult Samsung keyboard.
leneight ratingfour Reset of phone required to fix issue temporarily.
