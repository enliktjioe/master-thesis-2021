lenten ratingtwo great game, but too many repetitive bubble tip pop-ups.
leneleven ratingfive give more fish bucks and lower prices, but it was awsome
lenseventeen ratingtwo i hate that after i get a new phone i have to start the whole game over.
lennine ratingfive wish breeding was quicker but looooooooove the app anyways!!!
lennine ratingfive love this game but it lags on my phone
lentwentynine ratingthree like but freezes phone alot new event frozen on training so can't complete a little disappointing, and wish could use coins instead of game dollars to revive fish.
lennineteen ratingtwo it made me continuously click a frog in a bubble, then froze up on me, so i deleted it.
lenten ratingfive why is algae reappearing in certain tanks immediately after cleaning....
lenten ratingfour i just wish it was easier to earn fish bucks
lenseven ratingfive forcing me to update is pretty rude.....
lenthirty ratingfive i was on level 36 and now i update and lose everything all because you decide to force me to update to a flawed version, thank you for ruining this game!!!!!
leneleven ratingfour wish there was a faster way though to get more fishbucks.
leneleven ratingfive give more fish bucks and lower prices, but it was awsome
lentwentynine ratingfive it's a great game very relaxing for me an keeps me busy so i never get bored,one thing needs fixin,ukeep same game even if switchin phone.
lennine ratingone i did not receive the two frogs for breeding.
lenten ratingone please give me my  frog so i can breed them.
lensix ratingfour wish could get fish bux easier
lentwentyfive ratingfour only one thing to make it better, a sign in. so when you get a new phone you don't have to start from scratch.
lenten ratingfour wish best decorations were available with coins instead of bucks.
lennine ratingfour wish i could earn bucks instead of buying them.
lensix ratingfour cost of best fish too high.
lentwentytwo ratingone did not get my fishbucks when i download game also played the froggy event and did not get breedable frog to breed
lenfourteen ratingone would someone like to explain why the frog challenge just ended a day early?
lensixteen ratingfour wish there were faster growing fish and that there were minigames to play to kill time
lenfifteen ratingfive the only thing i wish is that if you can turn coins into fish bucks.
lenthirteen ratingfive like 10,000 coins could get you 2 fish bucks and 20,000 coins could get you 5 or 6.
lenten ratingfour should be able to earn cash other ways than ads
lenten ratingfive love this game but is so hard 2 earn fish bucks
leneighteen ratingfour but maybe have the option of buying fish bucks with the coins, something to get more and faster.
lenten ratingone didn't get my $22 fish bucks for downloading ship wrecked!!
lentwentyone ratingthree this game can be very fun but it takes up so i much of your time taking care of the fish!
lentwentyfive ratingthree if you don't feed them for a day all the fish die, it sucked when i went on vacation and lost all my fish!
lenthree ratingone ripped off    75 bucks...
lenfifteen ratingone beware of this app,   when  a fish burp's  good bye to your fish bucks.
lennine ratingone get your missing, lost or stolen fish bucks back.
lenseven ratingone and refuse to replace missing buck's.......  :(  :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :'( :'(  :'( :'( :'( :'( :'(
leneighteen ratingthree wish you could earn more fishbucks within the game itself, but overall its cute and easy to play.
lenfifteen ratingone love it just wish there were more breedable fish that didn't cost fish bucks
lenthirty ratingfive update update fead up of the game stopping unexpectedly and only option is to force to close y can't there jst b a simple update makes the game work
lennine ratingfour if only it was easier to get fish bucks....
lennineteen ratingfive great game, just wish it didn't take so long to breed the fish! 3 days is a bit much.
lentwentythree ratingfive love it think its cool only complaint is i don't get the free fish bucks from the earn free fish bicks part
lenseven ratingone poor would not connect to the internet: (
lennine ratingfive its plays well but items ony last so long
lensixteen ratingfive i love the game i just wish it didn't take so long to get money
lensixteen ratingfive i love this game but i do wish that you could get fish buck way easier
lentwentyfive ratingfour love the game,  but it needs to have more fish you can buy with coins and less that you have to use the fishbucks for.
lennine ratingone to complete the game will cost u more than $200.
lenthirtyfour ratingtwo so, you aknowledged the fact that the frog challenge had a glitch by changing up the way to purchase the eggs but you won't reimburse the fish bucks lost because of that glitch?
lenfourteen ratingfive the only doubt is u can't get fishbucks 4 fishcash or whatever it is.
lentwelve ratingfive its just i ain't willing to spend money for fish money
lenseven ratingfive great ggame but takes too much internet
leneight ratingfive only thing i would change are the notifications.
lentwentynine ratingfour would rate it a 5 star but for some odd reason i can't breed any of my mystery fish so it's like if i bought them for nothing!:(
leneighteen ratingfour also lower the fish prizes a bit please and it will definitely be a 5 star game for me!!!:)
lentwelve ratingfour pass time favorite ,only dwn side is can't get fish bucks
lenfourteen ratingfour great game can't stop playing, just wish breeding didn't take so long
lenthirtyone ratingthree this app does events all the time that make you accidentally use "fish bucks" which are almost impossible to earn and all the coolest stuff you have yo pay for with.
lensix ratingone never got my 100 dollar worth fishbucks
lenthirty ratingfive i went to open my game an it says new bee event but nothin is there so u went to see if it needed updated an its up to date.
lensixteen ratingfive plus i lost 20 fish bucks during the frog event & i'm not sure how it happened.
leneight ratingthree takes way too long to breed fish though.
lensixteen ratingthree and it is irritating that you don't stay in the shop when buying multiple fish.
leneight ratingthree clicked on  bubble and accidentally lossed all fishbucks.
lenseven ratingthree would like to get the fb back.
lentwentyeight ratingone was fun, but, the new bubble is ridiculous, and when i went to.buy one fish, i couldn't make it stop until i had no more bucks.
lentwenty ratingone also, alot of the free buck opportunities, do.not give you.the bucks and the fish prices have become outrageous :(
lenthirtyone ratingfour i would say the only thing i dont like about it is that its hard to earn fish bucks,and alot of fish you have to buy with the fish bucks....
lentwentytwo ratingfour so i would rate this app as perfect if you were able to get free fish bucks and or earn them easier...
lentwelve ratingone and twice since the update all of my fish bucks have disappeared.
lensix ratingone i want my 20 fish bucks back
lentwelve ratingfour love this gane but would be great if the fish grew faster
lennine ratingfour wish there was a better to get fish bucks
lentwentyone ratingfive its fun and is like having real fish could do with some different plants and decorations to be added on though.
leneleven ratingthree needs more "free cash & coins", but over all very cool game.
leneighteen ratingthree i like the app but it wont let me buy fish so there is point keeping the app.
leneighteen ratingthree would like more coin fish less $ fish and the tasks given to be for coin fish not $ fish
lennineteen ratingtwo the fish that i'm breeding for the current event are disappearing when i move them into the tank.
lentwenty ratingfive i would really like if i could move to another device it seems to be taking a lot of space!
lennine ratingfour just wish you could earn fish bucks faster lol
lennine ratingfive i did not receive the two frogs for breeding.
lenten ratingfive please give me my  frog so i can breed them.
lentwentythree ratingfive great only thing that sucks is fish buck free offers. when ya try putting in numbers it kicks you out of the offers.
lenfive ratingfive easier way to get bucks
lenseven ratingfive force closes alot but still love it.....
lentwentyeight ratingfour great time waster but to many fish for fish bucks i mean i have no money for fish bucks there needs to be less fish for fish bucks.
lensixteen ratingthree pretty easy to use and hamless unless you get greedy to have mmore coins or money.
lennine ratingfour good game but need ways to earn more fishbucks
lenthirtyfour ratingtwo i do like this game but i want to be able to earn fish bucks.because all the fish i like are are fish bucks for example phrina is 20 fish bucks ani only have 2.
lentwelve ratingfour love this wish there want so many things to buy with bucks.
lenthirteen ratingfour love this game wish there was better ways to earn fish bucks though
lenthirteen ratingfive great game but would be better if didn't force close so much
lenthirtyeight ratingfive the game is great the only problem is that my memory on my phone fills up to fast and the weather makes it lage a little but been a loyal fan and player for a year or so.
lenfive ratingtwo drains battery on galaxy s2 epic 4g.
lenthirteen ratingtwo sold fish bred during breeding even but game cheated me out of 6k+ coins.
lenseven ratingfour wish you could earn/find more fishbucks.....
lenthirty ratingtwo but not anymore can't breed the fish that i want too buy fish to breed and won't let me do it what is the point of this game...
lennine ratingfive great but cost too much fish bucks to play
lenten ratingfour cons - sometimes gliches -waaaaay too hard to get fish bucks
lennineteen ratingfive love the game feel that there needs to be more breedable fish and more ways to earn fish bucks
lensix ratingthree would like to see more scale.
lentwentytwo ratingfive please fix it keeps sayin unable to conecte when i go to by fish but its a 5 star i love this game
lenten ratingthree good game but it just wants you to spend money :/
leneighteen ratingfour its cute but too many things cost a lot of fish bucks and its hard to get them....
lenfour ratingfour bucks no so fun.
lenthirteen ratingfour game is ok and the timing is not fun either but fool fishes
lennine ratingone every time i try to play it force closes.
lenseven ratingthree have lost fish bucks for no reason...
lentwelve ratingthree wish there were a way to trade or get fish from friends!
leneight ratingfive tack to long to load but good game
lenfour ratingfive fish bucks too expensive
lentwelve ratingfour its fun, but fishbucks and coins are way too hard to get.
lentwelve ratingfour you also should be able to do more things with your fish.
lenthirtytwo ratingfour bee playing this game since two years ago wheni first started with my iphone ; tthe only complain is i cant carry forward all my points and levels after i switched to note 2!
lennine ratingfive since last update i do not have some fish.
lentwentyeight ratingfive getting free fish bucks is getting harder & harder & has not been updated in a mo. customer service is great and this fish game is way better then others.
lentwenty ratingfive there is another glitch w/ feeding friends  takes up alot of space i have to uninstall & re install & restore alot!
lenfive ratingfour definitely need more coin fish...
lentwelve ratingfour is there anyway to get your game back if you switch phones??
leneight ratingthree too much stuff is bought with fish bucks.
lenfive ratingthree also it freezes a lot
lenten ratingfive wish you could get more coins, bucks, and spins faster.
lenseventeen ratingthree a moderately entertaining game but still requiring real money for fake fishbucks to do much of anything.
lenten ratingfive i wish all the good fish wasn't so high
lennine ratingfive great but cost too much fish bucks to play
lentwelve ratingtwo the cost to play is too high and the software is buggy.
leneight ratingtwo cost of fish bucks is unreasonable as well.
lentwenty ratingfour fun game, i love the variety of fish and decorations but it's so easy for your fish to die!
lenfifteen ratingfour i enjoy playing tap fish except for how hard it is to get fish bucks.
lenten ratingfour just would like to get more bucks for doing things
lenfortysix ratingfour i like  it but they dont give enough money or coinsand if u dont login everyday your fish die, i have a job soi cant play games everyday so they should have babysitter fish to buy for like 20 coins who freeze tank for your vacation needs
lentwelve ratingfive but some of the items an fish cost to much real money.
lenfive ratingthree a little cluttered and slow..
leneighteen ratingfive only wish there was a way to retrieve deleted tanks and transfer tanks from one phone to another.
lensix ratingthree its a little slow starting out.
lennine ratingthree coins are super tight but the games pretty fun
lenseven ratingfive need more ways to get fish bucks!
lentwentyfive ratingfour great game, but i wish there was a way to earn more fish bucks especially since the tasks make you spend a ton at once.
lenthirty ratingthree update update fead up of the game stopping unexpectedly and only option is to force to close y can't there jst b a simple update makes the game work
leneight ratingthree i love it just want more bucks rewards
lenthree ratingfour slow but fun
lenthirteen ratingfive i used to have fishlive but it crashed on me all the time.
lenfour ratingfive why is tapfish disabled
lenseven ratingfour forse closes allot when using certain feat.
lenfour ratingone updates killed my fish.
lensixteen ratingfour deffenetly 4 stars only 4 because a little hard when ur not able to play for a while
lenthirteen ratingfive i'd like to see more purchases available for coins, rather than cash.
lentwentyeight ratingfour i liked the game,but i needed to update my phone and application did not open,sad,had to uninstall,there were no instructions how to trouble shoot.
lenfive ratingfive great game but too slow
lennine ratingfour only problem is getting fish bucks to buy everything
lensix ratingthree love the game but sometime freezes
lenten ratingfive why can't we exchange coins in for fish bucks?
lenfifteen ratingfour would have gotten 5 stars if i could of kept the game when i changed phones.
lennine ratingfive becomes addicting and sometimes it had to froce close
lenthirteen ratingfive this game is really fun i like it exept everything cost too much
leneleven ratingfive i just wish it would quit shutting dowm for no reason.
lenfourteen ratingfive if u guys can fix that and stop wantimg so many fishbucks for things
leneleven ratingfour very fun good way to pass time could fix lag though
leneleven ratingfour it keeps glitching, and most times it tries to force close.
lenthirteen ratingfive we both love it i just wish u could make more money faster
leneight ratingfour jus wish it was easier to earn bucks.
lentwelve ratingfive great spp wish there were more ways to ean fish bucks tho.
lenseventeen ratingfive and wish there were more themed fish and backgrounds for the hoildays other thrn that great app
lentwentytwo ratingthree game is ok but there should be a way to get fish bucks like so many coins = one fish buck or something
lensix ratingfour it loads and updates sooo slow!
leneighteen ratingone the frog event sucks cocks every time i pop a bubble all of them fail wat the fuk !
lentwelve ratingfive won't even let me download it but rated it any way:-)
lentwentysix ratingfive love this game only thing i'm mad about is i got a new phone and lost all my fish and could not get anything back :-(
lenfifteen ratingfive this game is actually really fun, i wish you could get fish bucks easier though.
leneleven ratingfour i can't give it 5 stars though because it freezes up.
lentwenty ratingfour some easier way of earing bucks would be better as there are challenges that you can't meet without them.
lenten ratingfive with the recent android update, tapfish has gotten soooo slow!
lennine ratingfive i wish there were more challanges at a time.
lenten ratingfive and not so many requiring fish bucks to buy things.
lenten ratingfive just doesn't make sense to pay for fake money!
lentwentytwo ratingtwo also, there are too few options for those of us who can't/won't spend tons of money on fish bucks.
leneight ratingtwo aren't you making enough money through ads?
lenfourteen ratingtwo do you really want to continue trying to bore us into buying fish bucks?
lenfifteen ratingfour im not a fan of how the majority of fish and ornaments require "fish bucks"
lentwelve ratingfive it kills time but there needs to be a way to "pause"
lenthirtysix ratingone i downloaded shipwrecked and its been 2 days since i downloaded it and no free fish bucks are appearing in my fish bucks spot that's 22 fish bucks you owe me give them in 2days or i uninstall
lentwentyeight ratingfour accidently uninstalled reinstalled and restarted my sis went on and added me and it came up with my old 1 and all the fish dead but otherwise its great
leneight ratingtwo game should save itself to my play account.
leneight ratingfive only wish you could change coins for bucks....
lensixteen ratingtwo i updated tapfish because my phone said i had to, and the game had totally changed..
lenten ratingtwo it made me continuously click a frog in a bubble..
lennine ratingtwo then froze up on me, so i deleted it.
lenthirteen ratingfour like the game, but i wish you could earn more fish bucks faster.
lensixteen ratingfive i love it and so does my daughter just want more easier ways for fish bucks.
lenfifteen ratingfour great game but hard to get fishbucks which u need to get stuff in game
lenthirteen ratingfour takes a lot of time to level up and speed ups cost bucks.
lenfifteen ratingfive i love playing this game i just wished i could gain levels much faster amiga...
lentwelve ratingfour love the game just take to long to generate cash and bucks
lensix ratingthree way too slow for my phone.
leneighteen ratingone the frog event sucks cocks every time i pop a bubble all of them fail wat the fuk !
lenten ratingfour only one thing to make it better, a sign in.
lenfifteen ratingfour so when you get a new phone you don't have to start from scratch.
lensixteen ratingone now ive lot all my prizes  that's again tap fish, you're getting deleted finally
lentwelve ratingthree it sucked when i went on vacation and lost all my fish!
lenthree ratingone ripped off 75 bucks...
lenthirtyfour ratingtwo so, you aknowledged the fact that the frog challenge had a glitch by changing up the way to purchase the eggs but you won't reimburse the fish bucks lost because of that glitch?
lentwelve ratingfive it takes a while to load at first but its worth it!
lentwenty ratingthree it's fun but there isn't much to do after you clean the tank, feed and love the fish.
leneighteen ratingthree the bucks are impossible to earn, not enough instructions and to much waiting around for breeding to happen.
lensix ratingfive pretty cool but everything is expensive
lensixteen ratingfive i love it and so does my daughter just want more easier ways for fish bucks.
lenfiftytwo ratingfive i just wanna say that i love tapfish i just have one suggestion can u guys plz come up with some kind of password so that when friends who dont know what their doing grab ur phone and start messing with stuff dont sell all ur fish and mess up ur tanks.
lenfortynine ratingthree i think there should be a way to level up faster because it takes forever trying to level up, and maybe there should also be a breedable catagory for lazy people (such as i) that way we dont have to spwnd a half hour trying to find breedable fish
lentwentyfour ratingfive really good game only bad thing is tht most of the tsks u have to have fish bucks apart from that it is good
lenthree ratingfive do more batfish
lentwentyseven ratingtwo can't breed new fish often cause i can't get more than 2 tanks to bread, then it takes on average 3 days to breed one fish lol.
lenthirtyfour ratingfour however i wish a lot of the fish did not cost as much fish bucks as they do. its hard 2 earn enough of them in order 2 complete the tasks & it's expensive 2 buy them.
leneight ratingfour plus it is hard to get fish bucks.
lenfifteen ratingfour love this game but i agree there should be a way to level up faster
lentwelve ratingtwo could be a good game but is very slow & demanding of time
lenfifteen ratingfive cute game but have to play it every day or fish will die of starvation
lenfourteen ratingthree just wish it didn't take as long as it does to breed fish.
lentwentyfour ratingfive i don't realy like the pictures and how it's so flat and boring, but i like the huge the selection of fish.
lenthirtyfive ratingfive the game is pretty fun jusr wish that the fish bucks were easier to get and everything was cheaper but overall p0retty fun i would recomend it also wish the fish didn't die so fast
leneight ratingfour fun game but super hard to earn fishbucks
lensix ratingfive enjoyable game,,,slow to start though.
lenseven ratingfour wish the tutorial was a little slower.
lentwentyone ratingfour just wish it was easier to get fish bucks w/o having to buy them or download so many other apps.
lenthirteen ratingfour love the game but not 5 stars because the fish die way to fast
lenfourteen ratingfour love this game but i wish you could get more fish bucks for free.
leneighteen ratingtwo boring and stupid because you need lots of money to buy things and they barely give u any
lentwentyone ratingthree it's fun just long and alot of things you need fish bucks for but you barely get them for free
lenten ratingtwo for 2 days and now it won't open any more
lentwentyseven ratingfive i wish i never updated my tap fish game i used to be able to buy puffer fish that would bring in the $$ but not any more.
lenseventeen ratingfive i just wish it was easier to earn fish bucks to get all of the crazy fishies!
lennine ratingfour only complaint it takes a few seconds to load.
lenseventeen ratingtwo i love to play, but you need to spend lots of money to get fish to breed.
lensix ratingfive needs more fish and new fish.
lensix ratingfive could go a bit faster though
leneleven ratingfive you can't do much without fish bucks and they cost $.
lenten ratingfour game shuts down alot but other than that its great.
lenseven ratingthree stupid game give my more fish bucks
lenfive ratingfour hard to obtain fish bucks.
lennine ratingthree great game, but needs more fish for higher levels.
leneleven ratingthree i'm level 54 and there is nothing for several more levels.
lentwentytwo ratingfive like alot, love fish, dont like 2 spend real money or have 2 download stuff u dont want just 2 get more bucks or coins.
lenfour ratingfive needs fake money 2 spend.
lentwelve ratingone takes to long to level up and most quests take $ to complete!
lenthirteen ratingone it doesn't give u hardly any coins for tending to ur fish!
lennine ratingthree however, it takes way too long to earn bucks.
leneleven ratingthree the challenges are fun at first but then it gets old.
lenseven ratingthree it constantly asks to buy more bucks.
lenten ratingthree there should be an option to exchange coins for bucks.
lenseven ratingfour 4/5 hard go get fish bucks but fun
leneighteen ratingthree there should be an easier way to get bucks. how 'bout every 500 coins you get you get one?
lenthirteen ratingthree that way people can revive their fish without having to pay as often.
lenforty ratingfour i got a new phone and    now i cannot get back into the game that i have   spent so much money on i have been well over $1000.00 and it's a shame to lose everything that i just built up.
leneleven ratingtwo i paid money to remove ads and i still got them
lentwelve ratingfive but should have a way of buying fish bucks using your coins.
lenseven ratingfive wish the tutorial was a little slower.
lentwelve ratingfour very good game, some lagging but that might just be my phone.
lenfive ratingfive a little cluttered and slow.
lenfifteen ratingfive also alot of focus on fish bucks, which are hard to get without buying them.
lenten ratingfive i wish there was more way to earn fish bucks.
lentwenty ratingone this last update stole millions of coins from my tank not to mention all the bs with the frog event.
lentwelve ratingfive the only downfall is hard to get fish bucks without buying them.
lentwelve ratingfive maybe trading coins for bucks or awarding more bucks when leveling up.
lentwentyone ratingthree would rate higher but to obtain breeder fish and other things you need to pay2play and i just can't offord it.
lennine ratingthree dislike bubble tips and smiley faces on feed fish.
lenfourteen ratingfive it is very fun but make it a little more interactive with the fish
lennineteen ratingfour i wish they could put in a permanet mini game to get fish bucks,coins,fish or decorations ethre
lentwentytwo ratingthree its a cool game but its stupid you can progress if u don't have bucks wilhich u need credit card for
lentwentyeight ratingfour it'll glitch everytime i go to play store then exit it and click the game itself on the phone it just goes right back to play store
lenthirtynine ratingfive not giving all fishbucks when you download games also when foggy event was over did not receive breedable frog did not get my fishbucks when i download game also played the froggy event and did not get breedable froggy
lenthirtyseven ratingfour it does take an awfully long time to level up,  and it's unfortunate that so many basic things can only be bought with "fish bucks" which are very difficult to earn many of without paying money.
lennine ratingfour and many quests require you to buy these things.
leneighteen ratingfive i just wish you could advance up quicker yeah you can speed up your fish eggs to hatch.
leneleven ratingfour i can't give it 5 stars though because it freezes up.
lentwentyone ratingtwo it won't let me connect to the server. i report it every time but it is always the same thing.
lennine ratingthree won't let me participate in the easter event.
leneleven ratingthree every time i catch the fish, it says "image not found"
lentwentynine ratingfive i love it (but why will they make the decoration's and every thing so much you can just get a fish with that money and fish buck's
lentwentyeight ratingfive i 'v played this app before it crashs alot but i'm giving it a second chance if it did not crash i would have this app forevef
lenseven ratingfour its fun except every thing needs fishbucks
lentwelve ratingone love this game but very disappointed with the adds that pop up!
lensix ratingone you should monitor what's advertised.
lenfour ratingfour hate waiting but great
lenfifteen ratingfour takes a while to load but it already filled the last two hours of fun
lentwentyeight ratingfour it would be better if the game will allow me and my phone not to be on the internet all the time and still be this fun & cool!
lentwentythree ratingfour good but the good fish cost fish bucks which you have to buy with real money and the fish are way to expensive.
lennine ratingfour it also take way to long to level up.
lenseven ratingtwo can't breed the fish i want.
lenfive ratingtwo fish bucks are too much!
lenfourteen ratingfive thank you tap fish makers but please have more games to earn fish bucks !
lentwelve ratingfour wish it didn't take so long to breed special event fish.
lentwentynine ratingfour after the update the bubble icon is taking a lot of time this game is entertaining but it must be fast so to be fast please remove bubble icon
lenfourteen ratingfour i also love the breeding just wish it didnt take  do long to breed!
lentwentysix ratingfour the only thing i don't like is that if you miss the deadline on an event cuz of work or anything there is no extension.
lenseven ratingfour changed phones and lost everything which stinks.
lenthirteen ratingfive i'd like to see more purchases available for coins, rather than cash.
lennine ratingfive only wish fish bucks were easier to come by
lenthirteen ratingfive there needs to be a way to transfer my game to another phone.
lentwenty ratingfive spenf a lot if time and money on this then got a new phone and am having to start over!
lenforty ratingone ive switched phones, downloaded tap fish and i have to start all over again i believe i had pleanty more fish than the 2 i have now and my fish bucks are gone how do i get my fish tanks back.?
leneight ratingfour or be able to buy more with coins.
lentwentyfour ratingfour all the fish's eggs should be displayed under one head, instead of various categories and also the selling star rating should be displayed
leneight ratingfour takes too long to move up levels though
lenseventeen ratingfive great app try to purchase fish bucks though other apps but, still waiting the only bad thing
lentwentythree ratingfour but i do think a 12 hr breeding time for a total of 90 fish to breed is a bit long for shorter event time.
lenfifteen ratingfour im in love with this game, but fish bucks need to go i hate that.
lenseven ratingfour live wallpaper needs to be fixed also : (
lentwentyseven ratingthree the new event is not giving me the prize when i bred my fish and 11 hours thats a little to long to be able to get everything.
lennineteen ratingfour cool but one thing to say is that i wish u could earn fish bucks not buy fish bucks
lenfifteen ratingthree changed from 5 stars because the new valentines event takes 12hrs to breed and 6 days to complete.
lenfifteen ratingtwo this game is so  fun except tht the baby fish take for ever to grow
lentwentysix ratingthree i like the game save ur bucks their hard to come by seem like they want u 2 use cash to advance other than that good game
lentwenty ratingfive i like the events, but sometimes it kind of stinks when you don't have the fish bucks for them.
leneleven ratingfive and you really don't have good deals for fish bucks.
lentwenty ratingfour love this game, but i wish there was an easier way to transfer game from one phone to the next.
lenfourteen ratingone never succewd open even the internet connection available and in a hi speed wifi.
lenten ratingtwo this game takes up the most space on my phone.
lenfourteen ratingfour but the fonts in the menu are so small! especially inside the events icon.
lenfive ratingfour the graphics and fonts overlap!
lenfourteen ratingfour but wish the fish weren't so expensive or cost so many fish bucks
lenninetyfive ratingfive i love playing tapfish and wanna thank u for retrieving the coins i couldn't get but i really wish i wouldn't of lost all my tanks and all the work i had in this game for the past yr i lost a lot of tanks and fish that took days to earn and the money spent while i played .but i had to get a replacement phone ,same phone just wish i wouldst of lost all that i worked hard for should be a way to not loose games that would b awesome !
lennine ratingfive i want alot of fish bucks for free please
leneight ratingfour game not bad, but you start off slow.
leneleven ratingfour wish there was an easier way to get coins and cash.
lentwenty ratingthree joys of fun only downfalls is it takes forever to level up and fish cost way to much fish bucks.
lentwelve ratingthree not easy trying to earn fish bucks without actually spending real money.
leneleven ratingfive could use some form of sorting option but sure is addicting
lennineteen ratingfour it is very show moving store to i don't want to spend real money to get fish bucks.
leneighteen ratingfour it takes a long time to accumulate bucks to buy things or to speed up the breeding process.
lenten ratingfour i just wished that i could earn fish bucks faster
lenfive ratingfour need more fish bucks free!
lentwenty ratingthree a cool app just takes to long and  not  lot to do n between everything is a litle pricey too!
lenfive ratingtwo good game but constantly crashes.!
leneight ratingfive cool just wish you got fish bucks often
lenseven ratingtwo i still can't breed mystery fish.
lenthirtysix ratingfive ilove this game and so does my 3 yr old grandson he always asks gamma can i play fish with you only problem is when i changed phones i lost it all but it is fun rebuilding
lenten ratingfive some of the valentine species are a bit odd though!
lenseven ratingfive should get more free fish bucks though
lenfifteen ratingfive very addicting and time comsuming but it could use more ways to earn fish bucks.
lentwentytwo ratingfive my only complaints are that we should be able to still get our prizes from events even after the event is over.
lentwentytwo ratingfive the other thing is that you should have like bubbles or something pop up so we can earn xp, fb or coins.
lentwentytwo ratingtwo the valentine game is way too long,12 hours to breed, so no way to get half way through ribbing three breeding tanks.
lenfour ratingtwo note the disappearing bucks.
leneight ratingfive the fish bucks are too hard to get.
leneighteen ratingfour its fun with all the cute fish but i wish there were more events because they are fun
lenfifteen ratingfive during updates & events, i was losing my daily prizes & my free spin on the 5th day.
leneight ratingfour i love it just want more bucks rewards
lenfiftytwo ratingfive it's a really addictive game i love it but it keeps crashing my phone it always tells me to force close some of the breedable fish are to expensive and it's hard to get fish bucks without having to buy them with ur own cash ain't doing it uninstalled! !
lenfourteen ratingfour just wish it was easier to get fish bucks and more breedables for coins
lenfourteen ratingfive if you could buy more fish bucks using just fish coins thatd be awesome.
lensixteen ratingfive fun game don't like the fact that you have use real money to buy fishbuck
lenfive ratingfour slow to load but addictive
lenseven ratingfour good but taking days to grow fish
leneight ratingfive or be able to buy more with coins.
leneighteen ratingfive umm its trying to make me use my brothers acount to buy fish bucks ither than that good
lennine ratingone doesn't save and won't let me uninstall
lenseventeen ratingthree wish it was free instead of pay credit card.lame.don't download this game at all.
lenthirteen ratingfive populate tanks as you wish for fun or to unlock new fish & decorations.
lentwelve ratingfive great spp wish there were more ways to ean fish bucks tho.
lenseventeen ratingfive and wish there were more themed fish and backgrounds for the hoildays other thrn that great app
lensix ratingthree decent game,tough to earn fishbucks
lenseven ratingfive love it but somtices it forcefully close
lenten ratingfour wish it didn't take forever to level up though.
lennine ratingfour would give 5 stars but its slow loading different things.
lenfifteen ratingfour the only issue i have with this game is that it can be quite expensive!
lentwentytwo ratingfour it takes forever to earn "fish bucks" and almost everything requires you to use them for purchases, speed ups, most decorations, etc.
leneight ratingfour so real but hard to get fish bucks!
lenthirtyseven ratingone to pass a quest you need to buy a fish that cost 49 fishbucks and at the end you could sell it but its only worth some coins i thinking in removing game i dont recommend this game.
lenthirtytwo ratingfive been playing for like a year now the only thing that bothers me is the fish bucks it should be easier to get them and less fish bucks for fish and items!
lentwentythree ratingfive i gave it a five but i think events should last a little longer so that you get a chance to comlete them.
lentwenty ratingfive one other thing is some items shouldn't cost so much and you should have more chances to earn fishbucks.
lentwentyfive ratingone great game, but i wish there was a way to earn more fish bucks especially since the tasks make you spend a ton at once.
lentwelve ratingfour too hard to earn fish bucks/dollars and too many $$ only items.
lennineteen ratingfour reasonable price for extra coins and $$ but should be able to do all things without sending $$ with ads displayed.
lenten ratingthree you gotta have fish bucks for a lot of things.
lenthirteen ratingthree you can only get fish bucks by buying it or clicking their ads.
lenseven ratingthree i can't open tapfish since update.
lenfifteen ratingfive i love the game but wish it was easier to get fish bucks and quicker
lenthirtyone ratingfive i love this app at times it can run slow not sure if that is cuz my phone or connection speed but it doesn't make to much of a difference.
lentwenty ratingfive just wish once you wished a certain level you could buy mystery breedables with coins and not just fish bucks
lenthree ratingtwo stores stuff needlessly.
lenfourteen ratingtwo have to clear data and restore game periodically in order to free up memory.
lenfourteen ratingtwo restore sometimes installs data that is 5+ days out of date, so progress is lost.
lenthirteen ratingfive i think it would be nice to earn fish bucks in other ways.
lentwenty ratingfive may be you could buy fish bucks with your coins, charge us a sum of coins you couldbuy fish bucks.
lenfourteen ratingfour but the fonts in the menu are so small! especially inside the events icon.
lenfive ratingfour the graphics and fonts overlap!
lennine ratingfive fish bucks need to be easier to receive though.
lennineteen ratingfour cool but one thing to say is that i wish u could earn fish bucks not buy fish bucks
lentwentyfour ratingfour the only thing preventing the fifth star is that some people are able to 'cheat' by rooting their phones and giving themselves unlimited bucks.
leneleven ratingfive like very much but wish fish bucks were easier to get.
leneleven ratingfive could use some form of sorting option but sure is addicting
lenfifteen ratingthree it lags a bit and takes awhile to level up, but it's still entertaining.
lenfourteen ratingfour just if it were easier to get bucks, i would have gave it 5 stars.
lentwenty ratingtwo a cool app just takes to long and  not  lot to do n between everything is a litle pricey too!
lenfifteen ratingtwo need 2 come way down on all prices & giv out a lot mor gold & fish bucks!
lentwentynine ratingfive i love it but the new quest game is so dumb why the f$!k cant u earn fishbucks instead of coins i have over 4million coins i need bucks.
lennine ratingfive i had to restart due to accidental tank deleting.
leneight ratingfive we should have our stuff returned not deleted!
lensixteen ratingtwo where are my fish bucks  i did what they told me but disnt received fish buckz
lenseven ratingthree addictive, still a little glitchy and epensive
leneight ratingfour but memory it takes up is a joke.
lensixteen ratingfive just wish u didn't have to buy fish bums for a lot of ur tasks.
lensixteen ratingfive i love the game i just wish there was a easier way to get fish bucks.
lennineteen ratingfive i am getting a new phone and i hope i will be able to keep my tap fish progress.
lenfifteen ratingfive is there anything that i can do to transfer my progress to my new phone?
lenthirteen ratingfive i do not want to loose my fish, 300,000 + coins and my earned bucks.
lenseventeen ratingthree between forced closes, freezing, & constant charging fishbucks for most items required for quests, i'm just done.
leneighteen ratingfour i just wish it wasn't so hard to get extra fish bucks without having to buy them.
lentwenty ratingtwo a good fun game but the free stuff gets boring very fast and requires real money to buy more stuff
leneight ratingfive it's need to help make money faster
lenseven ratingfive wud like easier ways 2 earn fish bucks
lensixteen ratingfive this is a goid game but i wish you didnt have to buy the fish bucks.
lentwenty ratingfive so far tapfish is going good i just dont like it when you have to wait for the fish bucks
lennine ratingthree would be 5 but u need cash for almost everything.
lennine ratingthree got up to level 60 and lost all my progress.
lennineteen ratingthree it takes forever to level up and get enough coins to buy the stuff you want for your tanks.
lennine ratingfive just wish it were easier to earn fish bucks.
lentwentyone ratingfour great game but if level up is going to be so slow fish bucks should be easier to earn or buy.
leneleven ratingfour for some reason i can't even purchase fish bucks (error).
lenseven ratingfive force closes alot but still love it.....
lentwentythree ratingfive love this game, would rate higher but after about 3 weeks it now is telling me that i have to connect to the internet.
lenthirteen ratingone lower the prices on things have an income of money if done 5 stars
lenseven ratingthree not a bad game, but annoyingly slow
lensixteen ratingfive its totally fun and addicting but you run out of fish bucks and  coins to easily
lenseven ratingfive fun needs more ways to win prizes.
lentwo ratingfive cheaper fish
lenthirtyone ratingfour this game had great graphics and a wide variety of different fish, but you needed a lot of "fish bucks" to buy most of the ones you need for your achievements.
lenfortyfive ratingfour i am addicted to playing it but i wish you could earn more fish bucks more easily cause i am now stuck and can't complete any task without any fish bucks and can't get any fish bucks cause i can't complete tasks
lenthirteen ratingfive just wish the really cool fish and accessories weren't quite so expensive.
leneleven ratingfive would be nice if it was easier to get fish bucks.
lenfifteen ratingone it can be fun but using the new version and it still loses your money.
lentwentyfive ratingone this app stole  75 bucks beware of this app,  it locks up,  and or is  glitchy the (game) will stell your hard earned money from you.
lentwentyseven ratingone go ahead and buy fish bucks, or download the apps they want you to try to earn bucks, and have a fish burp good bye fish bucks.
lenseven ratingone and refuse to replace missing buck's.
lenthirtyone ratingfive i love this app at times it can run slow not sure if that is cuz my phone or connection speed but it doesn't make to much of a difference.
lentwenty ratingfour would be 5 stars if adverts did'nt keep on popping up and the coins and fish bucks were all free
lentwelve ratingone new year event start on ios devices but not on android devices?
lenseven ratingfive we just hate waiting on breed process ;)
lenthirtynine ratingfour pretty fun to play for awhile but tedious must keep up with it on a daily basis in order to receive full benefit will need to purchase fish bucks so if your cheap this isn't game for you
lenseventyseven ratingfive but sucks because it says you can earn fishbucks by downloading apps and doing other things when it doesn't its such a joke you can't get anywhere in this game without the fishbucks, and if it freezes my phone up again, im done with it, ive had to start over several times in this game, have, thought bout buying fishbucks but i will be damned if i pay for something that will just be lost!
lentwentytwo ratingthree the game is great except i got a new phone and couldn't transfer it over so i had to start over.
lennine ratingthree also it keeps stopping and closing for no reason.
lenten ratingfour should be able to earn cash other ways than ads
lenfortyone ratingthree i found a better fish game with cuter fish i got tired of this game force closing and i cant seem to make enough fish bucks to keep my fish alive i got really bored but it was fun for awhile
leneleven ratingfive love it just try giving more free fish bucks as prizes.
lenseven ratingfive have yet to have a force close.
lennineteen ratingfour well, its good but it takes too long to breed and u can only do one at a time
leneleven ratingthree but it's getting very frustrating with it closing down constantly.
lenforty ratingthree i have a suggestion also for breeding is it possible to do the same on both sets of breeding where if there's only certain fish that can breed together that all the others disappear like the mystery tanks do??
lenthirtyfour ratingthree it's gotten better not sure if it's from upgrades you've done or that i've upgraded my phone which by the way for some reason could not get my old game
leneight ratingfive just wish i started off with more fishbucks
lenforty ratingfive in the last few days though i've noticed that the fish aren't swimming smoothly like they usually do, don't know if it needs an update i've tried logging out and in but its still doing it.
lensixteen ratingfive i love it but i wish the fish didn't take so long to grow up
lenfourteen ratingfive just wish you didn't have wait so long for the fish to breed.
lenfour ratingfive why is tapfish disabled
lentwenty ratingthree this game could have better information,help,better upgrade on this tapfish game,better news,no pay credit is lousy.
lennine ratingone :-( after the latest android update.my 70 tanks are gone.
lenten ratingtwo it only lets me breed 2 fish in the mystery breeds.
lentwentytwo ratingfour which either takes forever to earn, costs actual money, or you have to take surveys and download/play other apps to get.
