       "'In general, the app is awesome, but there are a couple of issues which don\\'t give me the desired user experience. 1. The map is delaying from the driver\\'s map, and is lagging when the driver gets another route than the one on the map. 2. I can\\'t add MasterCard cards which were issued by another bank other than YooMoney (the issue is that I have a YooMoney card and a Visa one issued by anoyher bank, and I want to add another card issued by the same bank, which is MasterCard, and I can\\'t add it); Bad expirience in Chisinau. Price at the end of the trip differs from the offered at the beginning. In my case was +20%. My wife faced similar situation. It doesn\\'t matter there\\'s traffic jump or not.; This is the worst experience one can have with the Taxi app. Fares are almost always wrong, navigation doesn\\'t work neither for driver, nor for user taxi is always in the wrong place and if you can\\'t get to the place they are at the app still charges you full rate. Most of the employed drivers are rude and some even criminal. Also sometimes APP RANDOMLY CHARGES SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY FROM CARDS, IN HOPES YOU WON\\'T NOTICE!; OK in the beginning but now gets worse with every update and use. This last time (and the final) it asks me where I want to go and sends the taxi there instead of to where I am. Waste of my time, waste of driver\\'s time. 5 texts trying to cancel went nowhere. At 70 years old it\\'s easier to carry my groceries the kilometers from the supermarket than deal with this app.; Impossible to rate a driver if you dismissed a popup (especially if you ordered a taxi for someone you need time to get feedback from the person, but the app force you to do reply immediately. This should be available from order history at least during 24h after the ride). Very good UX, minimum of clicks required.; I use courrier functionality. The courier does not see the info in the field \"sender\". Pls make these info more visible for the courier. The app lacks chat with the courier, which is convenient to send to the courrier IMs with order no. etc. Would be also great to have integration with telegram or whatsapp to send IMs directly from this messengers to the app (courier); Drivers are ok, cars are ok, customer service- fail. You use e-service, but can\\'t get e-receipt for ride. Customer service can not assist you, only a lot of useless words. If you are in Baltic states better use BOLT! Same navigation, same price, and you receive you receipt right after ride.; Great app, but there are a few map delays.; Becareful of this app.. often the taxis will part 45 minutes away so you have to walk and then they charge you extra waiting time I asked what the problem was they tell me the system takes them to the wrong address; Used the app very often, but after I changed my phone can\\'t set-up my account. SMS with verification code doesn\\'t arrive. Wrote to support but got no response.; App is ok but often shows the incorrect position on the map(30-60 meters away from actual location), while Navitel/Google Maps show more precise position on the map; All good. One suggestion - to add the option to choose female driver. I, personally, would be willing to wait longer for a female driver to feel secure, especially at night.; List of partners does not load. After an unpleasant experience, I wanted to blacklist a carrier but am unable because the list of partners will not load.; Great taxi service app, really simple. Also you can share the app to friends and get free rides which is always awesome!!!; The worst taxi app I ever used. Doesn\\'t point right address and then fees me with more than half of the price of the ride.; Bad service, charge me for waiting and almost missed my flight, not correct location for me and driver claim i got my ride.; Cost efficient and very simple to use; Very poor utilization of gps . Always stuck at one place doesn\\'t move around; the app billed me for the tip although I opted out from doing so at the end of my trip; An amazing useful app... incredible navigation and a great map guides.. user friendly... so polite drivers... in fact all of Armenian people are polite... thanks yandex.. thank you Armenian drivers; Impossible to rate driver if accidentaly dismissed pop-up. Otherwise perfect.; Got \"Sent SMS limit exceeded\" error right after the first try, however never tried to use it before.; Hogs as much as 3gb of memory. I have to uninstall it after each use or my phone gives an error message, \"memory full.\" What are you putting on my phone?!; Excellent app with excellent price but a little bit problem with map. Please check and fix.; An exceptionally good application especially for foreigners who don\\'t understand local language it\\'s very easy to move from one point to another.; Worst service from drivers and from customer support too I didn\\'t booked any cab just i checked the price but money debited from my account and I msgd customer support they didn\\'t helped me and worst service ever had...\\U0001f92c; Good service. Driver was very kind and cooperative.; Why customers are rated? We are paying you for rides, not for scores. Aggressive pushing of eats and lavka is ridiculous. It is not even shown on screenshots. Drivers do not care about traffic code and support doing nothing for years giving you sweet talks about caring. This is garbage, not a ride-hailing service.; Occasionally will set pickup point to some random area on the map; Drivers are not a accepting payment from card. Most of the drivers are cancelling when you try to use the taxi by online payment. They only accept cash and they\\'re saying that taxi service is not providing their money after the ride.; Incorrect positioning after Go update, terrible location detection and floating cars; Poor location detector. Food delivery doesn\\'t work; Wish interface had a button to bring locator to your current location.; Taxi doesn\\'t arrive. Yandex Go customer service say it\\'s not their problem. Ie you\\'ll be waiting for a taxi for ages and for no reason it can be cancelled; Easy to use, very efficient and accurate. The new update is great because it allows you to report when a driver isn\\'t wearing a mask.; Nice taxi app. Should add a option to say how many people will take the ride.; Drivers pick up the ride from far away area, 10 min and more become standard awaiting time; Good application,fast and comfortable; Provide otp system. Driver should need an otp from costomer to start the ride; Rating fragment is collapsing on application resume. I wasn\\'t able to rate my ride.; Bad system the drivers are going the wrong way and when i cancel i have to pay it the system should need a change try uber rules maybe; In uzbekistan very well programme but there is some issue with maps. I think it will be ok; Really good taxi service !!! I recommend in Belarus; Solid app, with amazing navigation and map accuracy in Kazakhstan; Bad interface, hard to make order.; Buggy app. Rude customer service. Worst experience ever. Don\\'t use this!!!; In Belarus it\\'s just horrific, mapping is terrible. Drivers are suffering as well as passengers! Shame on you yandex Belarus; What\\'s wrong with those \"unpaid\" rides??? Why do they keep popping up?? Sort your payment system out.; Economy rides are cheaper than other apps, though the app is very buggy. Location is often incorrect. Other times it is requesting cash during the ride on credit card transactions. Today I paid cash and it took money from card as well. Economy cars are usually depressed and not very clean with the drivers who are not well behaved. Generally I would recommend ordering comfort cars and having cash on hand or just downloading BOLT APP WHICH IS BETTER; Without this app,maybe pay more money than enough for taxi in armenia and almost drivers in armenia don\\'t say truth about real price for destinations, specially when they realize you are not armenian people and cant speak armenia language🙁; Bugs occasionally, sometimes driver seems static howere when I call he says he\\'s moving towards me; I don\\'t like instead of looking on the order and going where u are they ask u where and its annoying; One of the best I ever used. A try will confuse you. Perfect to recommend 👌 👏 👍 🙌; This app has many bugs. They used to have a good customer service but that is no longer the case and you\\'re on your own if anything happens. Can no longer rely on their customer service. Their map showed me on a complete different location than were i was standing and all the customer service could do was charging me the cancellation fee and blaming me for their mistake. Also recently drivers push the button that says they arrived before they arrive. So they can charge you waiting time.; Customer support is really weak. Driver\\'s are not experienced and they get away with everything they do. There is no way you can get refunds when you are charged with false accusations. I put 2 instead of 1 just because this application is sometimes cheaper compared to some other apps. I\\'m editing this review and I change 2 into 1 star, since your driver charged my guest I paid for with card. Your customer service is replying some none relevant formal letters as always.; I like this app, but lately I can\\'t add a card for payment.; Please add payment method via card for Uzbekistan. It is getting difficult to find a change for taxi; The navigation is buggy, the service is sending the driver through a route that does not exist physically. Get ready to climb fences and walk hundreds of meters to find your cab.; Great but doesn\\'t work with foreign bank cards.; Worst prediction time ever. Always not on time; This app is very convenient and easy to use; Update: cannot rely on it lately as it is not charging my cc and says that o have unpaid ride, then i try cover that manualy with other cards, but it is processing the payment forever.... And I need a car right now. Offers me to pay cash which i fo t have on me... Payments processing seems to be super buggy lately. Will use citymobil for now. Works fine now! So far so good, and cheaper then the rest, thanks! No more fixed rates to the airport tho, as it used to be with Uber:p; I put my card as payment method and in a span of one to two weeks it has deducted more than 5 GEL without me using, hiring or ordering any taxi or service! I had to delete my cards from the app and then uninstall it.; Nice application, however i\\'d like to see special navigation application without food or pizza or anvil delivery. It wold be better to have a switch turning theese very important parts of applicatio off, so they dont burn my cpu ;); has a lot of problems. location and etc. Support never answers, oh sorry they will answer after one day that they are checkin this problem and dissapier forewer. they charge you for their problems. I will never use this app again.; The map doesn\\'t rotate on your app. It is a big minus.; I have been using this app since a long time but now for a while I am not able to put my number. It shows sms limit exceed. Please fix it..; I wanted to like the update with Yandex go, but each separate function is more difficult to use than in the separate apps. Yandex food for instance have limited interface and smaller window.; Hi, Yandex. You already have the separate app for food delivery. What are the reasons for adding this functionality to the taxi app? Have you heard of Occam\\'s razor?; Im in the car right now and it actually is pretty good. It smells nice and i sometimes get car sick but right now there isn\\'t any problem. It is pretty good.; Very useful app. Easy to use!; Write on phone screen 650rsd on final say on phone screen 778rsd but on driver display is 810rsd?? So at last be more expensive than ordinary taxi; No dark mode and not option to select at what time the taxi comes. It has translations in English and automatic translations for text which is good.; The app is easy to use and the price is clear to notice and understand. Good drivers, confortable even with economy service; I was charged with exact amount that it showed but in 20 minutes I was charged 0.13 more :) why?; Extremely bloated with unrelated services to the point it doesn\\'t resemble the app from the screenshots. Promotional push-notifications.; If you use some vpn on your phone it struggles to connect somehow, most likely cuz data origin contradicts GPS location.; Seems to charge extra sometimes; Very bad app. Drivers phone did not work and app counted riding time as wait time and i had to pay 2 lari extra.; The most inexpensive rides with excellent quality of service.; When Yandex.taxi just launched it was OK, now they literally expect you to chase the driver if he happens to miss the pick up point. This is especially fun if you have broken leg.; Support service is very helpful. They answered me 5 minutes after my request, returned my money and gave promo code. Thank you for your work!; Clean and safe ride. The driver is a gentleman; Very secure, faster.; App is easy to use. Short waiting time for taxi and You can see arrival time and number of the taxi; Outstandin App. It works pretty good.; Very expensive! No ways to order a taxi with a good price... :(; Brilliant driver one. He is jack of all trades.; Terrible app. Horrible customer service. And if you are an American, your debit and credit card probably won\\'t work. They\\'ll tell you it\\'s your bank but it\\'s clealrly Yandex.; Precise ,on time ,professional; If you register your card, they take more money than needed. Very bad.; So nice and easy at the same time to take rides; I like the app. Works well and fast; GPS does not work properly.; the best platform for taxi thought they are a bit expensive they offer the best class; Very nice and super fast service 👏👏👏; Awful UI. Why on earth would I need your food store promotion in a taxi app?; Map not always correct; Some drivers are good some are mean.; Remove passenger rating! Drivers would give you 1 if you have yandex plus discount - that is not right!'"
