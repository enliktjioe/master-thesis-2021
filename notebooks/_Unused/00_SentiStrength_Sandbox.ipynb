So apparently bolt encourages people to sit still and not move in the car, which was the response I got from customer service and no refund. The second time, I had a dental appointment and ordered a cab, the driver came and then he said where are you going? As soon as he found out what the location was, he got frustrated and swore and said ‚Äúthis is too far man I‚Äôm tired‚Äù. I asked why he had accepted it in the first place if he didn‚Äôt want to go too far. I didn‚Äôt get any proper explanation and no apology. I was in pain because of my dental extraction too. So I had to cancel from my end because he said he couldn‚Äôt do it. He said he would text bolt and let them know. And I messaged Bolt 3 days ago and still no reply. They have charged me ¬£3 for this trip that didn‚Äôt happen. Terrible terrible drivers and very bad customer service.

After 20‚Äô and after the first driver called to tell me to walk to a convenient location for him, he did not manage to pick me up and cancelled the trip. I then order another car which gives me another 10‚Äô waiting time as the driver was completing a trip nearby. The ETA of the car kept changing in unrealistic times  and varies between 4‚Äô-5‚Äô when the car was really at least 10‚Äô away still.
