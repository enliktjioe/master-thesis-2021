Customer support then contacted the driver who claims he waited for 6 minutes and customer support claims on their system it showed he waited for 6 minutes, which is funny because their system was showing that he was there even though he wasn‚Äôt. With the time of me ordering the car, waiting the 2/3 minutes for him to get to me and my call to the driver and customer service there is no possible way the driver waiting 6 minutes. I even have the screenshots to prove it. Then customer support tells me I‚Äôve not been charged and they are offering me ¬£3 off the next journey. #%# %*^!

I asked why he had accepted it in the first place if he didn‚Äôt want to go too far. I didn‚Äôt get any proper explanation and no apology. I was in pain because of my dental extraction too.

      "I would have given negative stars if I had a choice. I called a cab via bolt a couple weeks ago to go from Westferry to Spitalsfield Market.

So he arrived, I got into the car, he suddenly said, oh you are going to congestion zone, I m not going. And he basically said he doesn‚Äôt want to go he won‚Äôt go in many ways. But I was already sitting on the car. So he kicked me out of the car. Instead cancelling/completing my trip, he then went on driving with the app still showing that I was on the ride. So I called their Helpdesk, told them this incident. And I said I want to make a compliant about the driver. So the guy on the other end of the line said ok we will give him a warning. So I asked what‚Äôs gonna happen if he gets a warning, he will still be allowed on the platform and repeat his behaviour. The guys said yeah he will get a few warning then of course we will off board him. I said ok I want someone to email me to let me know the result of my complaint. He agrees. But then nothing. I heard nothing from Bolt. If they don‚Äôt have strict rules about drivers‚Äô conduct, how can they ensure the safety of their customers? If they don‚Äôt take complaint and feedback seriously, do they even intend to improve the service? Or do they just want to get as much investor‚Äôs money as possible and sell the app and retire?

      "I had used a discount on bolt which allowed me 60% off my next 5 journeys up until the 25th August 2019. I don‚Äôt like using my card details especially with cab apps as they may take more than the fare. I had ordered a cab at 06:30, 06:31 I received a call from the driver who said they would be there soon and similarly on the app it said he‚Äôd be here in 5 minutes. 12 minutes go by and the arrival of the driver had been saying  1 minute for 4 minutes straight. I looked on the map and the driver was heading to my destination instead of my pick up point and even after trying to call him through the app, the icon didn‚Äôt let me. It only let me message him and even after that, no response. I couldn‚Äôt even call back the number he had called me on because he had been using a number from the main switchboard and didn‚Äôt go through when I tried. I cancelled the journey and when I tried to rebook it, I left no money on the card I used on the app as the journey I was taking was ¬£6 and when I booked the journey it said the promo covered the journey. I use Monzo so when I get charged I get notified immediately. Why was ¬£10 attempted to be taken for a ¬£5-6 journey?! And when the driver arrived after multiple attempts of trying to book, he said aggressively ‚ÄúStop booking, you have no money in your account‚Äù. At that point I walked off and had to take TfL to work because this was the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had with a cab service ever. This may not be everyone‚Äôs experience but you‚Äôre only as good as you‚Äôre weakest link. Bolt, you‚Äôve lost a profitable customer and I will surely be warning any friends that try your service.\n",

      "They are the most worse company. Disgusting drivers and disgusting costumer service. First time I used Bolt the fair came in a lot higher then the highest expected price didn‚Äôt think much of it just thought because of traffic etc. Second time I kept watch on the drivers satnav and right Infront of my eyes saw him ignore the satnav and purposely took a longer route. Now be it was about 10pm over the Christmas period  I had all three of my children with me and didn‚Äôt want to say anything with the plan to get into contact with the costumer service team. \n",
      "On making the phone call and explaining the situation it came back that he did indeed ignore the route the Bolt satnav had told him to take so in other words to get more money from me he went the longer route. Disgusting human! Costumer service gave me a ¬£5 good will gesture as well as the ¬£5 in the extra fair cost. So again it came to me having to arrange a traci for my brother his wife and children to get home. I ordered the cab with using the ¬£5 voucher looked up the fastest route from mine to my brothers and proceeded to track the journey via the app. And guess what? Guy did the exact same thing. Instead of doing a straight right down the middle route he went up and away from my address around and back down. Google‚Äôs maps that night gave me the quickest route and it should of only been a 35/40 mins journey which turned into a 1 hour and 25 min journey so you can imagine the fair price. I was absolutely livid. I screen recorded me going from my google search which showed the direct route then into the app and recorded the whole journey. Next day I again called costumer service after submitting a formal complaint through the app with the screen recording and screen shots of the driver fair that was expected and the fair it ended up to be. Again they made me right in what I was saying but refused to refund the money into my bank account on the basis it would be unfair on the driver. Instead offered me a voucher with money of my next few journeys. That voucher added up to ¬£20 from the added extra fair! I pointed out why in the hell am I going to accept that when the money is going straight back into your sick and disgusting company. Your company is a disgrace and your drivers are equally that to. Unsafe drivers with green cards. How can you employ people who are so sly and devious! Costumer service made me right but would not accept any wrong doing. How can that be. STAY WELL AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. I almost certain TFL will be getting reports from young women/men of being taken over safety issues. Mark my words\n",

If I have known that I would have paid almost ¬£20 more for my ride I would have looked for an alternative and that‚Äôs what I initially intended. However this app was the cheapest out of Lyftt and Uber as a lot of people not just me have definitely used before or would rather.

Why do you provide a promotion if I am not even getting one? It‚Äôs unacceptable to offer and promote a promo (discount) for a ride if the customer does not receive it. If your app calculates that it will charge its customer a certain amount of money, why does at the end of the calculated route show that the customer has to pay more? If initially the customer is meant to pay the price that you guys make up, cuz you can‚Äôt even explain to me why would be better to just show that price, not a discounted ride and then I end up paying more for what I was offered.

De plus, suite √† cet incident j‚Äôai d√©cid√© de contacter le service client de l‚Äôapplication une personne ayant r√©pondu √† mon m√©contentement mais n‚Äôayant fait aucune d√©marche de compr√©hension et aucun acte d‚Äôanalyse sur cette augmentation de course multipli√©e par 5. Je souhaite signaler que le service client de l‚Äôapplication est d√©plorable, certes l‚Äôapplication propose des promotions mais une fois la course finalis√©e l‚Äôapplication ne prend en compte aucun m√©contentement du client effectu√© sur la course.  Je suis habituellement une personne qui faisait souvent appel aux services de cette application et je suis tr√®s d√©√ßu par le manque de professionnalisme et le service client qui n‚Äôest pas pr√©sent.\n",

En arrivant chez moi j‚Äôen avais pour 80 euros. C‚Äôest mon chauffeur qui m‚Äôa alert√©e alors que j‚Äôavais fini la course en me disant de contacter le SAV, le montant √©tait exorbitant, lui m√™me √©tait tr√®s √©tonn√© il a pr√©f√©r√© me pr√©venir, et pas du tout annonc√© ni valid√©. En effet je connais le principe de majoration, j‚Äôutilise depuis quelques ann√©es des soci√©t√©s de VTC. J‚Äôai dormi sur mes deux oreilles en recevant ma note en me disant que le service allait me rembourser comme il s‚Äôagissait d‚Äôune erreur. J‚Äôai contact√© le SAV qui n‚Äôa jamais voulu m‚Äôentendre et m‚Äôa tr√®s clairement expliqu√© qu‚Äôil ne me rembourserait jamais.
